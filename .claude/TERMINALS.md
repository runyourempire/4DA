# Terminal Coordination

## Protocol
1. **Before editing**: Read this file. If your files are claimed by another terminal, STOP.
2. **Claim files**: Add your entry below with the files you'll touch.
3. **Commit Lock**: Set `**Commit Lock**: HELD` before committing. Only one terminal commits at a time.
4. **After committing**: Remove your entry and release the lock.
5. **Conflicts**: If two terminals touch the same file, the one that committed first wins. The other must rebase.

## Active Terminals

<!-- opus-ledger-engine (2026-06-15): DONE — committed local, push HELD for operator (4DA is the
     default branch; per global rule 6 the push is the operator's call). FOURDA_STRICT_MANIFEST=1
     makes the headless engine surface ONLY manifest-grounded release/vuln items for the receipts
     ledger; all paths gated, desktop byte-for-byte unchanged when unset. Closed 4 leaks (A registry
     defaults/0.15-gate + dep union; B crates.io discovery feed; C targeted Go proxy fetcher; D OSV
     routed via dependency matching, CVE global feed suppressed). Caught+fixed two issues live: a
     startup deadlock (strict union called get_database() inside build_all_sources -> re-entered the
     SOURCES_REGISTERED Once) and an npm fetch_items_deep EXTENDED_PACKAGES leak. VERIFIED: all 4

     changed logic but never bumped it, so the fix was dark on the 60.8k v5 corpus; bump = convention
     per 168d41fc; full lib 3850/0, gate PASSED). Rebuilt fourda.exe + fourda-engine.exe (new code) —
     the hourly "4DA Background Refresh" task uses fourda.exe so it now drains with NEW code. Ran 6
     headless cycles: backlog drain active (1228 v6), precision proven (Traefik non-dep CVE 0.50->0.25,

     shared src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx (UnifiedAppBar consumes it), pinned top-right end-4 in
     Onboarding.tsx as the mirror of the top-left LanguageSwitcher. Live-verified both themes in
     the wizard via Victauri (sun on void / moon on paper, in-place flip, sun-logo asset swaps).

     zero-signals -> capped-at-Medium. Verified: 94/94 module incl. against isolated empty
     FOURDA_DATA_DIR (the exact fresh-checkout condition that failed in the audit worktree); full
     lib 3,844/3,844 x2; fmt + clippy clean. NOTE: one UNRELATED flaky failure appeared in ONE of

     4da-theme), src/lib/theme.ts (useTheme/useGeometryPalette/initTheme + native titlebar
     setTheme), sun/moon toggle in UnifiedAppBar (i18n x13), 421 text-white -> text-text-primary
     (16 orange-CTA keepers triaged line-level), inverse/gold CTAs tokenized
     (accent-primary-hover/accent-gold-hover), emissive layer ink-gold-on-paper (BrandMark,
     geometry SVGs, AmbientGlow), data-viz de-hardcoded (ContentGraph x3, RadarSVG,
     StackIntelligence, TranslationEditor, SourceBrowser, CalibrationStep), NEW
     sun-logo-light.webp (luminance-keyed cutout; founder caught the baked-black-disc splash
     live - raster assets audited, not just CSS). LIVE-VERIFIED via Victauri both themes:
     cold-boot persistence, splash, onboarding, main app, dark regression bit-identical.
     tsc clean, 1292 FE tests green, i18n 13/13, pre-commit + pre-push gates passed (no
     --no-verify). RULES FOR ALL TERMINALS now in memory project_light_theme.md: never
     text-white for page text; every new surface eyeballed in BOTH themes. Founder dogfood of
     light mode = the rule-10 gate. FLAGGED (pre-existing, not mine): ~31 eslint
     unnecessary-type-assertion warnings at HEAD in untouched files (toolchain drift). -->

**Claims (Wave 6):** src-tauri/src/taste_test/sprint.rs (NEW) + taste_test/mod.rs,
src-tauri/src/taste_test_commands.rs, src-tauri/src/lib.rs (registration lines only),
src-tauri/src/victauri_commands.rs (inventory), src/lib/commands.ts, NEW
src/components/calibration/* (surface + sprint UI), settings entry-point file (TBD exact),
src/App.tsx (nudge mount only), src/locales/*/ui.json (13), ts-rs bindings, tests.
NOT touching: onboarding wizard internals (reuse components read-only), calibration_fitter.rs,
migrations, peer claims (scanner/ace_commands/reachability/Cargo.lock/source_fetching/db sources).
W6 DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main 3dcb8725 (0/0; 30 files). LIVE-VERIFIED on rebuilt binary (dev server
LEFT RUNNING, fourda.exe PID 32008, victauri :7373): get_calibration_sprint_status honest (4->5 of 50,
curveFitted=false); 24 stratified real cards (cve/npm/rss spread); record_calibration_sprint_response
wrote feedback(444, relevant=1) - one disclosed mechanical-verification label (typescript release, in
founder's detected stack); nudge banner renders ("Teach 4DA your taste in 5 minutes" + privacy line);
[Calibrate] opens the overlay; phase 1 = the previously-unreachable taste test intro; overlay closed,
app left pristine for founder. Founder path to first calibration fit: take the taste test + label ~45
sprint cards (~10 min). Claims CLEARED.
W7 COLD-START INTEGRITY RUN DONE + PUSHED @ fdef8893 (0/0). Fresh FOURDA_DATA_DIR
(temp/coldstart-w7, kept) walked through the REAL first-run UI: trial auto-start OK, taste test
inferred the synthetic persona correctly, ACE scan OK, 1,343 items zero zero-vec embeddings,
context built (no GUI cold-start bug), health clean, Preemption 30 OSV alerts day one. TWO real
gaps fixed: (1) sprint had ZERO cards on no-LLM installs (samples only stamped by the judge) ->
scored-corpus fallback, 0->24 cards live; (2) FREE badge during active reverse trial -> "Signal
trial" badge x13 locales. Founder dev server RESTORED (pnpm tauri dev, bridge :7373). NOTE:
testing cleared the calibration-nudge dismissal in shared localStorage - the banner will greet
the founder (intentional). fourda-engine.exe was killed once mid-ledger-cycle to unlock a build
(hourly task self-recovers). Claims CLEARED.
W8 ADVERSARIAL ONBOARDING RUN (2026-06-12/13): live abuse-testing on fresh profiles + parallel
code review. 5 contained fixes (pathspec, all Rust + Onboarding.tsx; AVOIDED fable-public-surface's
OnboardingChoiceGate.tsx + locale-key claims, added NO locale keys): F-1 connectivity select! ->
select_ok first-success (corp-firewall false-offline), L1 heal corrupt settings.json on disk so
cached health stops reporting already-fixed corruption (live-verified: disk re-valid, health []),
F-12/13 clock-skew trial clamp (future stamp no longer = 379-day trial), F-16 synthetic taste
feedback dedup on re-onboard, F-15 onboarding-complete persist retry + keep step key on failure
(no silent wizard-every-boot loop). +5 tests. Build + gating/taste/calibration/Onboarding suites
green. Disconfirmed agent's F-26 (RTL): useDirection already sets dir=rtl - residual is
physical-property polish, FLAGGED not blind-fixed. DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main 0773bb9a (0/0,
cleanly atop peer STREETS-website e5ce5411). Founder dev server restored. Claims CLEARED.
NOT-FIXED findings handed to founder (need product decisions / bigger work): F-7 OneDrive
mass-hydration (Windows attr check), F-19/F-20 wizard stores unprobed keys + no 401 alert,
F-6 phantom fallback interests defeat thin-profile, F-3 mixed offline toasts, F-27 deterministic
briefing badge-at-generation, F-26 RTL physical-property sweep.
W9 SCANNER HARDENING (2026-06-13): fixing the not-yet-fixed adversarial findings. F-7 OneDrive
mass-hydration: shared is_cloud_placeholder guard (symlink_metadata file_attributes, no hydration,
dependency-free) wired into scanner extract_imports + parse_manifest + watcher extract_topics; fixed
the broken 50-file cap (counted only on import-hit -> read every import-less file); F-8/F-9 UNC +
bare-drive-root reject in is_system_directory (dead-share hang); F-5 cwd-parent fallback now
debug-only (packaged build walked %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs). Build clean, ace::scanner 47 +
scanning 2 green, clippy clean, +1 win test. Committing W9.
**Claims (W9-W12):** src-tauri/src/ace/scanner.rs, src-tauri/src/ace/watcher.rs,
src-tauri/src/ace_commands/scanning.rs (W9 - peer @opus-step1-edges claimed scanner.rs historically
but that terminal is idle/released; using pathspec on my hunks only). W10 (key validation/401):
src/components/onboarding/quick-setup-utils.ts, use-quick-setup.ts, settings/validation.rs (or
settings_commands), llm client + startup_health flag. W11 (phantom interests): use-quick-setup.ts,
scoring context/pipeline_v2. W12 (frontend polish): toasts/badge/RTL. NOT touching peer dotfiles.
W9 DONE + COMMITTED @ 64c97961. W10 KEY-VALIDATION + 401 ALERTING DONE in tree (policy:
warn-and-proceed, block only on definitive rejection): llm.rs note_provider_auth -> capability
Unavailable on 401/403 + report_restored on success; SystemHealthDot now polls get_capability_states
(60s) so runtime degradation surfaces (was boot-cached only); wizard probeKeyBeforeSave blocks advance
on definitive format/auth reject, allows on network blip/throw. capabilities 28 + llm 33 + 50 FE green,
tsc clean. Committing W10 (pathspec, 9 files; EXCLUDING peer site/* + docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md STREETS WIP).
W10 DONE + COMMITTED @ 5ee58786. W11 F-6 PHANTOM INTERESTS DONE in tree (frontend-only,
use-quick-setup.ts): stop auto-committing the generic fallback list (ML/Rust/TS) as interests -
shown as clickable suggestions only; empty interest set is the honest thin-profile state the floor
is built for. Phantom interests never reach backend, so the dampener works without backend changes.
tsc clean, onboarding tests green. Committing W11 (1 file).
W11 DONE + COMMITTED @ 60e2bdf3. W12 FRONTEND POLISH DONE in tree: F-3 (analysis-event-handlers.ts)
suppress "complete: 0" success toast when 0 results + throttle source-error toasts (cap 3 / 10s
window, rest -> console.debug); F-27 (BriefingContentPanel.tsx) deterministic-mode badge at the brief
itself (reuses existing settings.ai.briefFloorNoLlm key, no new locale keys). tsc clean, eslint clean
on my files, BriefingView 17 green. Committing W12 (2 files). ALL adversarial findings now addressed
except F-26 RTL physical-property sweep (needs visual pass) + F-23 data-dir probe timeout (minor).
W12 DONE + COMMITTED @ 2aab2999. W9-W12 ALL PUSHED @ origin/main 2aab2999 (0/0). W13 F-26 RTL DONE:
disconfirmed agent's "ml-* throughout" - onboarding had only 2 physical-property instances
(TasteTestStep text-right, setup-ai-provider border-l-2/pl-2) -> converted to logical (text-end,
border-s-2/ps-2; Tailwind 4.3 supports them, identical in LTR). LIVE-VERIFIED: switched app to Arabic,
document.documentElement.dir=rtl confirmed, reverted to en. tsc clean. Committing W13. ALL adversarial
findings now ADDRESSED (F-23 data-dir probe-timeout = minor, flagged). Founder dev server restored (en).
W13 DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main abb8b78b (0/0). ALL adversarial-run remediation complete + pushed:
W9 64c97961 (scanner cloud-stub + cap + UNC/drive-root), W10 5ee58786 (key probe + 401 alerting +
health-dot capability poll), W11 60e2bdf3 (phantom interests), W12 2aab2999 (offline toasts + brief
badge), W13 abb8b78b (RTL logical props). Full FE suite 1286 green, cargo build clean. ONLY-REMAINING
(minor, flagged): F-23 data-dir writability probe has no timeout (slow UNC profile could hang ~boot);
F-21b keychain-failure silent plaintext fallback deserves a visible notice. Founder dev server
restored (en, bridge :7373). Claims CLEARED.
COLD-START INTEGRITY RE-RUN (2026-06-13): found + fixed a SEVERE cold-start bug. taste_test_finalize
(the default onboarding path) wrote inferred interests via apply_taste_to_context's raw INSERT with NO
embedding column -> 0 of 16 interests embedded -> interest_score collapses to 0 -> every item caps at
the 1-signal ceiling (~0.23) -> 0 of 1216 scored items clear the 0.4 relevance gate. A taste-onboarded
user got a DEAD feed. Founder unaffected (add_interest embeds; 3/3 -> 5750 relevant). FIX: finalize now
embeds inferred interests via embed_texts + engine.add_interest upsert (correct BLOB, same 768-dim
space as items). LIVE-VERIFIED on the fixed binary: 16/16 interests embedded (3072 bytes), and
run_cached_analysis went 0 relevant/max 0.10 -> relevant items appear/max 0.456 after clean context
load. taste_test 62 green, clippy clean. Claim: src-tauri/src/taste_test_commands.rs (pathspec).
Committing now. (Cold run also re-confirmed: trial badge=SIGNAL TRIAL, F-6 interests all 'inferred'
0 phantom, F-16 no taste-row dup, scanner cloud-guard compiled, health []. ThemeToggleButton
ReferenceError = dev-HMR transient, recovered on reload, not a product bug.)
DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main 4b13a7f2 (0/0). Cold-start interest-embedding fix shipped. Cold-start
re-run otherwise CLEAN (health [], trial+SIGNAL TRIAL badge, F-6/F-16 confirmed, scanner guard, real
embeddings, connectivity online). temp/coldstart-cs* dirs kept for inspection. Founder dev server
restored. Claims CLEARED. REMAINING (minor, flagged): UnifiedAppBar ThemeToggleButton const-after-use
(dev-HMR transient only, prod-safe); F-23 data-dir probe timeout; F-21b keychain plaintext-fallback notice.
COLD-START RE-RUN #2 (2026-06-13): found + fixed the biggest cold-start bug yet. After onboarding
(taste test + scan), the FIRST analysis scored 0 relevant / max 0.232 (dead feed) and only a RESTART
fixed it (-> 6-14 relevant, max 0.81-0.89). ROOT CAUSE: TWO context caches - CONTEXT_ENGINE (cleared
by invalidate_context_engine) and a SEPARATE 5-min-TTL SCORING_CONTEXT_CACHE (scoring/context.rs) that
had NO on-demand invalidation. Onboarding completes in <1min, so build_scoring_context kept serving the
empty startup context until TTL/restart -> every new user's first feed was dead with no way to know a
restart fixes it. FIX: new invalidate_scoring_context_cache() wired into invalidate_context_engine (so
all interest/taste paths clear both) + ace_full_scan now invalidates after storing detected tech.
LIVE-VERIFIED on fresh profile WITHOUT restart: both caches invalidate in log, analysis -> 14 relevant
/ max 0.814 (was 0/0.232). scoring::context 48 + ace_commands 12 green, clippy clean. Backend-only
(4 Rust files). NOTE: 168 peer frontend files uncommitted in tree (NOT mine, untouched). Cold run also
re-confirmed: trial active 14d, surfaces honest-empty, interests embed (my prior fix), onboarding
persists. LOW-PRI noted: auto-seed-decisions warns on fresh DB (vestigial, reads empty tech_stack at
Phase-9 migration; harmless). Committing now (pathspec, 4 files).
DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main 93d39979 (0/0). Stale-scoring-context fix shipped + live-verified
(14 relevant, no restart). Cold-start re-run #2 EXHAUSTIVE + clean: trial 14d, surfaces honest-empty,
briefs work (free=real content, AI floor=deterministic 1234ch), sprint=24 cards, onboarding persists,
SKIP-everything path = honest 0-relevant + NO crash (0 interests = thin-profile floor, correct).
Founder dev server restored. temp/coldstart-cs* kept. Claims CLEARED. REMAINING (low-pri, flagged):
auto-seed-decisions log warning on fresh DB (vestigial, seeds nothing, harmless - left untouched to
avoid migration risk); ThemeToggleButton dev-HMR transient (peer adding ThemeToggle to onboarding);
full real-UI visual verification deferred until peer's 168-file frontend WIP commits (backend verified
via bridge = origin/main truth).

### Terminal: opus-db-hygiene (started 2026-06-11)
DONE — committed LOCAL @ d7c23f0f (4 .rs files, pathspec; push HELD for user). The "Database is 522MB,
run optimization to reclaim space" banner was a FALSE ALARM: freelist_count=0 -> VACUUM reclaims 0, the
528MB is all live content (50,772 embedded items, ~11MB/day, 6 weeks old). Retention was also inert (90d
noise-prune floor vs a corpus that turns over in weeks; 82% of items score <0.20). FIX: (2) startup_health
+ monitoring size-warning now fires only on RECLAIMABLE freelist space (>=100MB), honest copy; new
Database::reclaimable_bytes() is the shared signal. (3) noise-prune floor 90d->30d (autophagy_commands) +
the bounded relevance-forget (score<0.05, cap 5000) now runs on the daily maintenance cycle (monitoring),
VACUUM'd by the existing run_maintenance. Tier 1 (out-of-tree, gitignored data/): deleted 2 stale DB
backups + 2 dead model blobs (nomic-embed, bge-small) = ~1GB reclaimed; KEPT active arctic-embed + active
bge-reranker + osv npm.zip mirror. cargo check + clippy --lib clean, fmt clean, 81 history/autophagy tests
green (+2 new). Code takes effect on next backend rebuild/restart.
  >> @opus-step1-edges HANDOFF (TIER 4, your domain — I did NOT touch it): dependency_edges grew 121,600 ->
     133,760 rows in minutes during my analysis (1,061 snapshots, no visible dedup/retention on detected_at).
     ~29MB now and unbounded. Recommend a retention cap in YOUR migration/queries: keep latest snapshot per
     (project_path, ecosystem), prune older edges + GC snapshots whose project_path no longer exists on disk
     (the worktree/temp dupes you already found). Left to you so it composes with the reachability engine
     (which reads edges) rather than me deleting data it may need.
  >> FOLLOWUP @ d7c23f0f shipped + pushed (on origin/main via peer rebase). LIVE-TESTED on restarted
     binary: get_startup_health returns [] (false 553MB banner GONE; freelist=0). BUT testing caught a
     defect: scheduled prune used max_age_days (= user retention) as its noise floor, and this instance
     has retention=365d, so the prune was INERT. FIXED: noise floor now min(30, retention) in monitoring.rs
     so confirmed <0.05 junk is forgotten at 30d regardless of content-retention.
  >> ALL DONE + PUSHED to origin/main (rev-list 0/0). Three commits total: d7c23f0f (warning logic +
     retention + reclaimable_bytes), d90e55e3 (noise floor min(30,retention)), cacb87f9 (Settings "Optimize
     now" button wiring run_deep_clean + 3 tests; revived the dead 13-locale maintenance strings so the
     honest size-warning points at a real control). Tier 1 ~1GB reclaimed out-of-tree. Pre-push gate green
     (1288 frontend tests incl. my 3, fmt/clippy/tsc/eslint clean). Live: get_startup_health=[] (false
     banner gone). Pending: eyes-on the Settings button render (bridge was rebuilding; logic unit-covered,
     run_deep_clean chain proven in source — not a ghost). Tier 4 (dependency_edges cap) still @opus-step1-edges.
  >> FIREHOSE WORK (user: "fix the firehose properly", APPROVED). Disconfirmation found my scheduled
     noise-prune is a REGRESSION vs the 2026-06-05 manual-only/deletion-breaks-search decision; and a
     pre-ingest semantic gate was already measured+rejected (funnel). Plan: A revert scheduled deletion
     (manual-only) [DOING]; B registry stack-filter (crates_io 12k/92% non-stack); C adaptive yield-throttle
     (huggingface 10.5k/4-useful) via source_autopsy engagement -> fetch volume. sources/* now CLEAR
     (@opus-source-resilience released; only unbuilt Mastodon staged).
  >> A (revert) DONE + committed @ a694425a (monitoring.rs; scheduled noise-deletion removed, manual-only
     honored). C (adaptive yield-throttle) CODE-COMPLETE + VERIFIED, awaiting commit:
     NEW source_fetching/yield_throttle.rs (pure fetch_cap policy + 6 tests, all green) + db/sources.rs
     get_source_relevance_yields(window,floor) + wired into BOTH ingest paths (fetcher.rs .take, processor.rs
     fetch_items_deep). cargo check clean, clippy --lib exit 0, my files fmt-clean. DATA-VERIFIED on live DB:
     huggingface 2%hit->cap5 (90% cut), bluesky 3%->6 (88%), hackernews 15%->29 (42%), crates_io 16%->33 (34%);
     reddit/devto/arxiv/SO 32-59%->50 (full); osv/cve exempt->50; lemmy/npm/github/pypi cold-start->50.
     reddit/devto/arxiv/SO 32-59%->50 (full); osv/cve exempt->50; lemmy/npm/github/pypi cold-start->50.
  >> A + C DONE + COMMITTED (unblocked once @fable-audit committed blind_spots.rs). a694425a (revert
     scheduled noise-deletion -> manual-only) + b3c2da22 (adaptive yield-throttle, 5 files, 6 tests).
     Pushing to origin (pre-push gate running). B (registry stack-filter) = staged next wave; C's yield
     mechanism already throttles crates_io 34%, so the firehose's worst offenders are handled.
**Claims (firehose):** CLEARED. **Commit Lock**: RELEASED (opus-db-hygiene).

### Terminal: opus-window-hygiene (started 2026-06-11)
DOMAIN A DONE (outside repo, nothing committed): the self-hosted GitHub Actions runner no longer flashes
a console at boot. Root cause = console-subsystem Runner.Listener.exe launched by an interactive boot
task. Rejected S4U/service (no-stored-password S4U = local-resources-only → no network to GitHub; service
needs the Admin password or runs as LocalSystem and loses the .cargo/pnpm toolchain). Fix: one
deduplicated task (removed the duplicate that errored every boot) launching D:\actions-runner\run-hidden.vbs
(wscript GUI-host, SW_HIDE, waits + propagates exit code so RestartOnFailure still works; run.cmd keeps the
self-update restart loop). Backed up both old task XMLs to D:\actions-runner\_task-backup-2026-06-11.
Verified: runner online+busy:false via gh api, no visible window, single task Running.
DOMAIN B (in repo) — committing now. New build gate scripts/check-no-window-spawns.cjs (+ .test.cjs, 10
tests) requiring every Windows-reachable Command::new to set CREATE_NO_WINDOW (inline OR via helper),
with a unix-only allowlist + // no-window-ok marker. It found 7 real latent window-flash spawns: 4 were
false positives (local_audit.rs uses a suppress_console_window helper → taught the gate helper-indirection)
and 3 were REAL (engine_scheduler.rs schtasks install/uninstall/status) → FIXED with creation_flags. Wired
into package.json (validate + test:scripts), .husky/pre-commit (when .rs staged), .github/workflows/validate.yml,
and codified as INVARIANTS.md INV-043. cargo check + clippy --lib clean, fmt clean, gate 41/41 safe, 10/10 tests.
Pathspec commit (only my 8 files); did NOT touch the 3 pre-existing untracked files (engine_receipt_pubkey.hex
/ fourda-infer-proto/.gitignore / target-verify/) or any peer claim (step1-edges, secaudit Cargo.lock).
**Commit Lock**: RELEASED (opus-window-hygiene) — done @ f3992dd3/b385324b/813d6acb (window gate, hygiene,

### Terminal: opus-source-resilience (started 2026-06-11)
Working on: the TIMELESS answer to API enclosure (reddit/X/SO walling off content). Building the minimal
durable primitive — an AccessStrategy trait + ordered, health-gated FAILOVER in the Source layer — proven
on the hardest real case (Reddit: JSON strategy -> RSS-bridge fallback; .rss verified HTTP 200 where .json
times out). North star = trust-model DIVERSITY (no single access-failure mode load-bearing); local-first
per-user fetching as the edge advantage. NOT refactoring all 20 adapters (incremental adoption); NOT
touching the OSV/preemption/dependency/db-hygiene files peers are editing.
**Claims:** src-tauri/src/sources/access.rs (NEW), src-tauri/src/sources/reddit.rs,
src-tauri/src/sources/mod.rs (module decl only). Zero overlap with opus-preemption-fix (osv/sync.rs,

DONE: access.rs (AccessStrategy trait + resilient_fetch failover, error-precedence, 6 tests) + reddit.rs
refactored to [reddit:json -> reddit:rss] strategies (Atom parser, 4 tests) + mod.rs decl. cargo check +
clippy --lib clean, fmt clean, 10/10 new tests green. Pathspec commit (3 source files only).
DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main ec924d74 (rebased onto peers a392e992 by a push race — ALL peer commits
intact, 21eca8b6 verified in-history, nothing clobbered, sync 0/0). Design doc: .claude/plans/

### Terminal: opus-step1-edges (started 2026-06-11)
Working on: Step 1 = dependency edges -> reachability ranking (greenlit). Increment 1 (foundation, ships
SILENT): dependency_edges migration + edge-extracting lockfile parsers (Cargo.lock/pnpm/npm) + edge storage

### Terminal: opus-preemption-fix (started 2026-06-11)
Working on: making the Preemption feed surface the 87 real CVEs (was empty). User-driven (/remote-control
live audit -> approved plan execution). (A) Bug A severity case in dependency_commands.rs get_dependency_overview
(`== "critical"` lowercase vs UPPERCASE store -> "0 critical/0 high" over real RCE CVEs) -> eq_ignore_ascii_case
[DONE in tree]. (B) OSV sync root-cause: /v1/querybatch returns ID-stubs (no `affected`) -> store_vulnerability
stores 0 EVERY time, unguarded delete_stale then WIPES the mirror -> Tier 1 empty. Fix: guard delete_stale
(only when total_stored>0) + ZIP-mirror fallback when API stores 0 (npm/crates zips on disk, 906/486 matched).
(C) Option B (unify dependency_alerts) DELIBERATELY NOT DONE — live testing PROVED it would inject FALSE
positives: liquidjs CRITICAL is STALE (installed 10.27.0 > fixed 10.26.0, already patched); vitest 3.2.x
CRITICAL is OVERLY BROAD (OSV: vuln introduced 4.0.0, so 3.2.x NOT affected). dependency_alerts is a lossy
partly-stale store; the OSV path (Option A) is MORE accurate. Surfacing dependency_alerts wholesale degrades
accuracy. (Overrides the plan's "B then A".)
DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED on :7373 (fresh build 12:06): osv_sync_now -> osv_advisories 0->884 npm + 367 crates;
osv_get_matches 0->477 (280 confirmed: axios/hono/react-router/clerk/jwt...); get_preemption_alerts total

cargo fmt clean, clippy --lib exit 0, osv 51/51 + dependency 51/51 tests pass.
**Claims (committing):** src-tauri/src/dependency_commands.rs, src-tauri/src/osv/sync.rs (pathspec only).
NOTE: zero overlap with opus-step1-edges claims; peer has mcp-4da-server/* STAGED — NOT touching it.

remote npm ETag advanced (b3ed9064) past cached 2026-06-09 (a41ca27b) => is_cache_stale=true.
ALL DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main: 506eb91e (osv ZIP fallback) + 21eca8b6 (severity case) + a392e992
(ZIP-freshness ETag refresh). Restores Preemption feed (0 -> 30 osv_verified alerts) + dependency dashboard
(0crit/0high -> 3crit/27high). My push carried peer d7c23f0f up; peer later pushed ec924d74 (0/0 sync).
Option B (unify dependency_alerts) DELIBERATELY SKIPPED — proven live to inject stale/over-broad false
positives (liquidjs patched, vitest 3.2.x not affected). Claims cleared.
FOLLOW-UP (stale-alert resolution, user-approved): resolve_patched_dependency_alerts (dependency_health.rs)
re-validates active dependency_alerts vs CURRENT installed versions, auto-resolves when EVERY install is
confidently out of the affected range (reuses cve_matching::version_is_affected, now pub(crate)). Called from
the 6h health job + sync()/osv_sync_now. Also fixed a SIBLING of Bug A: load_security_alert_packages used
lowercase `severity IN ('critical','high')` vs UPPERCASE store -> matched 0 real CVEs -> no SecurityAlert
windows; now LOWER(severity). 3 new tests + osv 51 + dependency_health 16 + cve_matching 16 pass; cargo check clean.

LIVE-VERIFIED on real prod data: 8 genuinely-patched alerts auto-resolved (liquidjs x6 @10.27.0, bytes
@>=1.2.1, rustls-webpki @0.103.x) with ZERO false resolutions; still-affected kept ACTIVE (shell-quote
1.8.3, vitest 3.2.x); dashboard 3crit/27high/87 -> 2crit/25high/79. Push fmt-gate was briefly blocked by a
peer's untracked unformatted mastodon.rs — waited, peer formatted (6feef500), then pushed clean (no --no-verify).
FOLLOW-UP (cosmetic cleanups, user-approved): (1) X/Twitter 401 — source only early-stopped on rate-limit;
an invalid/expired bearer key 401s EVERY handle each cycle (log spam). Fix: detect 401/403, stop for the run,
surface once via per-source feed_errors. (2) Orphan osv_advisories (141: NuGet/Maven/PyPI/RubyGems/Go — never
match user's npm/crates deps) — sweep in sync() keyed on current auditable ecosystems. (3) Stale-version scores
(2,437 @ v1-v4) — drain (merge_stale_drain_batch, 500/cycle) is correct + self-healing; triggering live, no code.

### Terminal: opus-scoring-recall (started 2026-06-09)
Step-1 fixtures (79767d09) now on ORIGIN (carried up by @opus-headless-engine's push — thanks; unblocked).
PHASE A + B0 DONE in working tree (measurement-only, ships NOTHING), COMMIT PENDING @opus-brief-quietfix's
lock release: metrics.rs (Strong/Weak recall split), reality.rs (breakdown + diagnose_strong_misses tests),
fixtures_gen.rs (faithful build_embedding_text contract + enriched interest descriptions), regenerated
fixtures/*.bin. 159 default sim tests green, fmt-clean. PROVED: aggregate recall is the WRONG target (70%
weak adjacency correctly dropped); real gap = generalist Strong-recall, root-caused to the 2-signal gate
(GATE=20-23, DOMAIN=0 — domain-crush is NOT the cause). Phase B (a gate.rs single-signal bypass for
high-stakes items) AWAITS USER APPROVAL — .claude/plans/scoring-recall-phaseb.md (rule-10 dogfood-gated).
PHASE B MEASURED + REVERTED (verdict: DON'T ship a gate change). Prototyped two single-signal gate
bypasses in pipeline_v2.rs, measured both, reverted both: (1) strong-interest (int>=0.85) — synthetic
R_strong +0.059 but mostly an embedding artifact, faithful-real near-neutral (F1 +0.008, precision -0.019);
(2) release-targeted — ~no-op (misses aren't release-classified). Conclusion: precision-first conservatism
is correct; residual Strong-recall gap resists surgical gate tweaks without eroding precision. Deeper levers
(richer item representation / broader release classification) are bigger future investments, not gate tweaks.
COMMITTING Phase A + B0 (measurement-only, ships nothing): metrics.rs (Strong/Weak split), reality.rs
(breakdown + diagnose_strong_misses), fixtures_gen.rs (faithful contract + enriched descriptions),
regenerated fixtures/*.bin. pipeline_v2.rs/gate.rs/pipeline.rs reverted to origin (no production change).
DONE + PUSHED @ origin/main 58863fde (0/0). Phase A + B0 measurement infra landed; Phase B prototype
measured then REVERTED (no production scoring change shipped). Verdict: precision-first conservatism is
correct; gate bypasses don't close the real-world Strong-recall gap without eroding precision. Claims cleared.

     @verax-terminal: complements your Experiment A. You ran the engine MANUALLY via curl; I verified the
     OTHER half — the Windows scheduled task fires ON ITS OWN. Installed "4DA Background Refresh" @ 1-min via
     IPC (runs fourda.exe --engine-once); Windows fired it → schtasks LastRunTime 10:30:00 PM, LastResult=0.
     It freshness-gated/skipped (GUI kept data fresh → exit 0, no receipt — correct). Task uninstalled after.
     So the production chain is fully covered: OS fires (me) → engine works-when-stale (Phase4/your ExpA honest)

     Preemption-tab first-paint latency (cold-start work item A). MEASURED first, fixed second: the
     returning-user data is PRESENT at boot (matches computed live from persisted advisories + deps),
     but get_preemption_alerts took 30-40s on every call — live OSV matching + an adversarial LLM
     deliberation (one call per Medium/Watch item). (The earlier "empty on cold start" reading was a
     wrong-command artifact: get_preemption_FEED doesn't exist → 51-char error misread as an empty feed.)
     Fix v1 (preemption.rs + app_setup.rs, +230/-10): in-process EvidenceFeed cache (once_cell Lazy +
     parking_lot Mutex, 10-min TTL, stale-while-revalidate, lock cloned+dropped before await); extracted
     compute_preemption_evidence_feed() shared by the command + warm path (Signal gate stays at the
     serving boundary); warm_preemption_cache() spawned off the boot path (+8s) so the first tab-open is a

     Resumed the stuck "Evaluate morning brief" loop; finished the eval and fixed the real bug it
     would have missed: the AI Brief hallucinated by FALSE ATTRIBUTION (welded a global axios/npm CVE
     onto the user's Axum/Rust backend), fabricated a "51-hour blackout" from a benign stale-file
     anomaly, manufactured PAT-theft urgency, and self-reinforced via the briefing-seal continuity
     loop. Root cause: brief synthesized free-form prose from raw content items + a tech-stack string
     with NO grounding, while the deterministic dep-scoped Preemption truth was never given to it.
     Fix in digest_commands.rs (1 file, +93/-5): lever 1 (drop StaleData anomalies from brief context),
     lever 2 (build_grounded_security_section -> CONFIRMED SECURITY block from OSV-verified dep-scoped
     Preemption feed; system-prompt makes it the SOLE security source; CVE news -> awareness only),
     lever 3 (system-prompt: continuity/seal context is thematic-only, ban briefing meta-commentary +

<!-- opus-stale-drain-ordering (2026-06-05): DONE — committed locally (push held for user).
     Completed the refinements opus-rescore-pipeline deferred. While verifying, found a THIRD,
     BIGGER root cause that subsumes "the drain doesn't fire" / "ecosystem_shift never surfaces":
     ★ ROOT CAUSE (the real one): get_stale_scored_items passed effective_hours=i64::MAX for SIGNAL
       users into `datetime('now','-'||?||' hours')`. SQLite OVERFLOWS that to NULL, so
       `created_at >= NULL` is never true → the query returned ZERO stale items for every Signal user.
       The live app is tier=signal, so the deep backlog (3828 stale items) was UNREACHABLE — the drain
       wasn't slow, it was empty. v5 only grew because the completion handler stamps recent items via
       normal scoring; the stale-drain itself never reached the backlog. LIVE-PROVEN via Victauri
       query_db: old signal predicate → 0 rows; new predicate → 3828 rows.
       Fix: for Signal (unlimited history) DROP the recency clause entirely (don't compute a giant
       offset). Free tier keeps the 30-day bound. Constant embedded (compile-time i64, no injection).
     • Fix 2 (ordering): drain was ORDER BY relevance DESC, but a version bump RESCUES items the old
       pipeline buried as noise (necessity try_stack_update_path: your own crates.io/npm release decayed
       to ~0). So relevance-DESC drained already-relevant items first, buried releases LAST. Now
       ORDER BY (content_type IN release_notes/platform_update) first, then relevance DESC. 583 stale
       releases (563 of them <0.3) now drain in the first 1-2 batches (500/run) instead of cycles 4-8.
       LIVE-PROVEN: first 12 of the new drain are all release_notes.
     • Fix 3 (fire on demand): extracted merge_stale_drain_batch() and ALSO call it on the full
       (non-differential) analysis path — previously the drain only ran in differential mode, so
       first-run-after-restart / manual run_cached_analysis never drained.
     Tests: 2 new in db::cache (release-first ordering; Signal no-overflow regression guard, returns
     1 not 0 for a 400-day-old item). Full lib compiles; clippy adds 0 new warnings; db::cache suite
     green. (analysis_status::abort_flag_resets_at_start is a pre-existing parallel-global-state flake —
     passes in isolation.) Files: src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs, src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs.

     END-TO-END LIVE-VERIFIED on a fresh rebuild+restart (killed old PID 52180, pnpm tauri dev):
     one run_cached_analysis (FULL path, last_completed_at=null → proves Fix 3 drains the full path):
       • v5: 524 → 931 (+407 backlog items drained in ONE run — was structurally 0 on Signal before).
       • stale release_notes: 583 → 259 (324 releases re-scored this run = 80% of the drained items,
         though releases are only ~15% of the backlog → release-first ordering working).
       • crates.io: axum v0.8.9 (opus-rescore-pipeline's exact buried example, was 0.17) → 0.644.
         npm react v19.2.7 → 0.909, crates.io tokio v1.52.3 → 0.893 — all rescued from noise.

     Two shipped fixes to make this session's scoring improvements reach the 35k backlog:
     • 168d41fc: bump PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5 (the stale-drain mechanism existed but my scoring
       changes never bumped the version → nothing was flagged stale).
     • b0cf5a85: NEW Database::mark_items_scored_version — stamp version for EVERY scored item.
       LIVE-FOUND via Victauri: drain stalled because persist filters top_score>0, so zero-score
       (noise) items were never stamped, stayed stale, and the relevance-ordered drain re-picked
       them forever.
     LIVE-VERIFIED via Victauri query_db: v5 bucket grew 0→437→467→524 across runs (drain works +
     progresses; stall fixed). NOT yet reached: ecosystem_shift items — the drain is relevance-DESC
     so low-relevance stack releases (axum @ 0.17) sit deep in the queue, AND per-run drain slowed
     after the initial 437 because the differential 500-batch stale-drain branch isn't firing in
     practice (diff=0 in logs across runs — last_completed_at/previous_results not establishing
     differential mode on manual invokes; the scheduler drains over time). That's the next refinement.

### Terminal: opus-rescore-pipeline (started 2026-06-04)
Working on: make this session's scoring improvements (necessity stack-update path, curated>synthesized
domain detection, ACE topic-noise filter, dep generic-word filter) reach the existing 35k-item backlog.
ROOT CAUSE: the stale-drain re-score mechanism already exists (get_stale_scored_items by
scored_pipeline_version < PIPELINE_VERSION, 500/run, ORDER BY relevance DESC) but my scoring changes
never bumped PIPELINE_VERSION (still 4) → nothing flagged stale → backlog never re-scored. Fix: bump 4→5.
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/scoring/mod.rs (PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5) — DONE/pushed (168d41fc)
- src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs (NEW mark_items_scored_version — stamp ALL scored items)
- src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs (stamp version for every scored item, not just top_score>0)
LIVE-FOUND BUG (via Victauri): drain stalled — zero-score items were never version-stamped
(persist filters top_score>0) so the relevance-ordered drain re-picked the same zero-scorers
forever; backlog could never fully drain past a band of zero-scorers. Fix stamps every scored item.

     Phase 0 of the MARS-inspired decay work: the per-topic calibrated-freshness path
     (scoring::pipeline.rs:199) was DEAD in prod — autophagy::analyze_topic_decay keyed half-lives by
     source_type (hackernews/reddit) but the pipeline looks them up by extract_topics() tokens
     (rust/react) → keyspaces never intersect → every item fell back to the crude global staircase.
     Re-keyed the producer to bucket by the SAME crate::extract_topics() vocab (title+content;
     source_tags not persisted) + MIN_SAMPLES_PER_TOPIC=3 guard vs Phase-3 proper-noun noise.
     1 file (topic_decay.rs, +116/-25), 2 new tests (topic-keyed not source-keyed; low-sample skip).

     Two domain-detection refinements on top of 7aea65e4, both forced by LIVE dogfood:
     • c96e22bf: weight ACE-inferred interests (cold-start users' interests are ACE-seeded source=Inferred).
     • 0af6e2d6: weight CURATED interests (explicit_interests, id=Some) > ACE-SYNTHESIZED (id=None). The repo's
       React frontend was synthesized into 5 web interests (react/typescript/javascript/next.js/express) that
       outvoted the 3 curated systems interests. id-based weighting fixes it.
     LIVE-VERIFIED on a guaranteed-fresh build: np flips web→systems (curated rust/tauri/axum win).
     ⚠ STALE-BINARY GOTCHA (cost ~40min): cargo kept NOT rebuilding after edits — running fourda.exe was
       OLDER than the commit, so warm reads showed the OLD web behavior. Fix: `touch src/probes_engine.rs &&
       cargo build` forces a real recompile (24s vs a bogus 1.5s up-to-date). Recipe saved.
     KEY FINDING (reported to user, NOT yet fixed — deeper than this scope): with honest systems targeting the
     calibration shows disc:1/recall:0 — the engine scores genuinely-relevant systems probes as noise
     ("Rust 2026 Edition" @ 0.257). PARTLY a probe-mode artifact (run_probe_calibration uses apply_signals:false,
     stricter than the real feed) — real feed DOES surface rust (Cargo advisory 0.6, Slumber TUI 0.535) but
     leans web (top item React/Next DoS 0.78). Candidate follow-ups: probe apply_signals:true to mirror feed;
     down-weight synthesized frontend interests in REAL feed scoring (not just domain detection).

     3 dogfood-found upstream quality fixes (the calibration numbers were honest, but the

         code identifiers, <3 chars) applied at the interest-synthesis boundary AND auto-seed.
     (2) dep subterm false matches (winston-daily-rotate-file "matched" an AI paper via
         daily/rotate/file) → added generic words to COMMON_ENGLISH_WORDS; full name still matches.
     (3) domain mis-targeting (Rust/Tauri/Axum dev classified "web" → probe battery tested wrong
         domain) → detect_user_domain now lets explicit interests/onboarding tech dominate, weights
         auto-stacks low, caps ACE-topic breadth, recognises tauri/axum/wasm as systems.

     Post-Phase-2 verification of the built-in LLM removal:
     • LIVE (running app, Victauri :7373): detect_ghost_commands → 0 builtin ghosts; check_ipc_integrity →
       healthy, 0 errors/106 calls; test_llm_connection (anthropic) → real round-trip OK through the edited
       llm.rs; get_diagnostics → 0 warnings, 0 builtin/sidecar/llama mentions. App recompiled + restarted
       clean after the merge (PID 44332).
     • GBNF concern resolved by CODE PROOF: complete_ollama_structured uses Ollama-native format:json (never
       GBNF — that was builtin-only); my edit only swapped a match→irrefutable-let returning the same schema.
       Zero Ollama regression. Ollama confirmed available (llama3.2/qwen2.5:14b).
     • Migration UNIT-TESTED (a7304418): single-instance guard blocks a clean cold-start, so extracted
       migrate_retired_llm_provider() + 2 tests (builtin→none+model-cleared; none/ollama/anthropic/openai/
       openai-compatible untouched). Settings::validate() confirmed not to pre-empt provider.

     in an isolated git worktree (dev server was live, would hot-reload mid-edit), then fast-forward merged.
     • Deleted llm_engine.rs (sidecar), model_manager.rs (GGUF catalog), settings_commands_llm/builtin.rs
       + the 7 builtin commands + lib.rs registrations + commands.ts contract.
     • Removed the `builtin` provider arm across the generation/capability stack (llm.rs, llm_stream.rs,
       llm_judgments.rs, ollama_capability.rs, ai_costs.rs, sovereign_developer_profile.rs,
       settings_commands.rs, health_checks.rs, 6 is_builtin_available guards, compute_has_llm) + the
       app_setup sidecar auto-start/shutdown. Dropped the llama-server-only StructuredOutputMode::Grammar
       variant + GBNF grammar — synthesis is JsonSchema for every provider now.
     • Migration: settings load resets persisted provider=="builtin" → "none" (manager_init.rs).
     • Frontend/locale: vestigial provider==='builtin' branches, 7 orphaned builtin-LLM locale keys ×13
       (built-in *embeddings* keys KEPT), sidecar error mapping. Removed 6 builtin victauri_dogfood tests
       + the builtin IPC-command assertions. .ai/FAILURE_MODES.md updated.
     • LANDMINES AVOIDED: blind_spots.rs/knowledge_decay.rs (Node.js builtin MODULES), calibration_*.rs/
       probes_engine.rs (fastembed embeddings, owned by opus-calibration-honesty-2), builtInSemantic* keys.
     Verified: cargo test --no-run (all compile), clippy adds 0 new warnings (4 remaining are pre-existing:
     domains/midpoint/sort_by), 3 compute_has_llm tests, tsc 0, 1260 frontend tests, validate:translations 0,

     The 5 P1 first-run "false-state lies" are fixed and COLD-START VERIFIED LIVE (fresh

     (1) calibrate "Setup complete" now says "Private semantic search active" (was the lie
         "AI provider configured" driven by embeddingMode) — screenshot-confirmed, old string gone.
     (2) Setup-complete tech/interest counts now from authoritative get_user_context (was
         optimistic store state); fresh profile correctly shows "No technologies / Default interests".
     (3) get_personalization_context_summary returns has_llm:false/llm_tier:"none" on no-provider
         (was true/"cloud" from a stale key) — live-invoke confirmed + unit test compute_has_llm.
     (4) removed the silent auto-pull of ollama models on "optional" setup mount; added explicit
         "Download required models" button (this machine's ollama was fully provisioned so the
         missing-model branch couldn't re-fire, but no auto-pull UI appears + path is gone).

- onboarding tests as needed (OnboardingChoiceGate.test.tsx)
- NOTE: app_setup.rs ACE startup logic UNCHANGED — we are NOT auto-scanning on skip (privacy). The
  scan is an explicit, consented, one-click choice at the gate.
- src/components/first-run/LoadingState.tsx (unique scan-ticker keys — fix dup rows)
- src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx layout (in-flow progress header — fix sun/heading overlap)
- src-tauri/src/ace_commands/scanning.rs (single-flight guard on ace_auto_discover — fix 92% stall)
