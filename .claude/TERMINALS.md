# Terminal Coordination

## Protocol
1. **Before editing**: Read this file. If your files are claimed by another terminal, STOP.
2. **Claim files**: Add your entry below with the files you'll touch.
3. **Commit Lock**: Set `**Commit Lock**: HELD` before committing. Only one terminal commits at a time.
4. **After committing**: Remove your entry and release the lock.
5. **Conflicts**: If two terminals touch the same file, the one that committed first wins. The other must rebase.

## Active Terminals

### Terminal: opus-privacy-truth (started 2026-06-05)
Working on: privacy-claim accuracy hardening (research-driven). Truth-fixing false "data never
leaves / zero telemetry" claims, making the cloud-LLM consent gate real, zero-retention defaults,
audit-proof NETWORK.md, positioning doc. NONE of these overlap the scoring/triage backend.
**Claims (by wave):**
- Wave 1 (copy truth-fix): src/components/framework/FrameworkSections.tsx, src/components/WaitlistSignup.tsx,
  src/components/briefing/PersonalizeNudge.tsx, src/components/onboarding/OnboardingChoiceGate.tsx,
  src/locales/*/ui.json (all 13), README.md, CHANGELOG.md, NETWORK.md
- Wave 2 (real consent gate): src-tauri/src/llm.rs, src-tauri/src/settings/manager.rs,
  src/components/onboarding/setup-ai-provider.tsx, src/components/onboarding/use-quick-setup.ts,
  src/components/onboarding/quick-setup-utils.ts, src/components/settings/AIProviderSection.tsx
- Wave 3 (zero-retention): src-tauri/src/llm.rs, src-tauri/src/llm_stream.rs,
  src-tauri/src/embeddings_providers/openai.rs
- Wave 4 (network doc): NETWORK.md, docs/NETWORK-TRANSPARENCY.md
- Wave 5 (positioning): .claude/plans/ (gitignored)
**Status**: Wave 1a DONE — committed local @ c164edf3 (Sentry fully removed; local Export Diagnostics
+ log_frontend_error; scrubber w/ 10 tests; crash_reporting_opt_in purged). Push HELD for user.
NOW: Wave 1b (truth-fix BYOK "data never leaves" claims in hardcoded components + 13 locales + docs).
**Commit Lock**: HELD (opus-privacy-truth) — committing repo+website claim-consistency pass.
ALL WAVES DONE + PUSHED (origin/main @ 3045be30). Consistency pass: site/src/*.njk (8) + ~22 docs +
tauri.conf.json listing. NEXT: commit, then A+ Tier-1 (settings disclosure, zero-retention completeness).
--- prior ---
ALL WAVES DONE (local, push held for user):
Wave 1a @ c164edf3 (Sentry->local diagnostics), Wave 1b @ daaa7417 (BYOK claim truth-fix, 13 locales),
Wave 4 @ e12656c8 (NETWORK.md audit-proof), Wave 2+3 @ 5d163182 (consent honesty + OpenAI zero-retention),
Wave 5 positioning doc (gitignored). victauri 0.7.6 live. export_diagnostics live-verified.
NOTE: running dev binary predates Wave 2/3 Rust edits (frontend disclosure live via HMR; Rust live on next rebuild).
Cargo.lock left uncommitted (not mine — windows-sys downgrade).

     PHASE 2 (backfill worker): the analysis path only scores a recent window, so ~88% of the corpus
     (31k items, 22k >7d old) was NEVER scored. New analysis_backfill::backfill_unscored_cycle scores
     the never-scored backlog in PRIORITY order (high-stakes → releases → recency via new
     db::get_unscored_backlog_chunk), persists + stamps version, convergent + resumable, NO LLM (cheap
     pipeline only), side-effect-free vs UI. Wired into the monitoring scheduler as a LOW-priority job
     every 120s (chunk 250), gated by scheduler_gate + cold-boot grace; idles to no-op once drained.
     PHASE 1 (observability): get_scoring_coverage command (cheap counts: total/scored/unscored/
     on-current-version %/version histogram) — the safety net that makes silent coverage collapse visible.
     LIVE-PROVEN: scheduler fires autonomously every 120s (dev log "Scoring backfill cycle" scored=250),

     • Wave 1 d5311628 — the ugly WebGPU "score fingerprint" CORE orb → native SVG RelevanceRing
       (arc=relevance, core opacity=confidence, currentColor=tier). LIVE-VERIFIED via Victauri: 5 gold
       rings rendered in AttentionCards, 0 fourda-score-fingerprint elements. Screenshots in D:\lightshot\.
     • Wave 2 ff131a9b — fourda-tetrahedron / fourda-simplex-unfold → native components/geometry/

       celebration-burst→ping rings (MilestoneOverlay), playbook-pathway→native node track (PlaybookView),
       turing-fire→AmbientGlow gradient (Briefing No-Data + Warmup).
     • Wave 4 be664e86 — deleted the whole apparatus: src/lib/fourda-components/ (69 files: .js/.frag/.wgsl/
       .d.ts), the registry, use-fourda-component hook, vite-env JSX decls, dead public/ notif-card+runtime

<!-- opus-stale-drain-ordering (2026-06-05): DONE — committed locally (push held for user).
     Completed the refinements opus-rescore-pipeline deferred. While verifying, found a THIRD,
     BIGGER root cause that subsumes "the drain doesn't fire" / "ecosystem_shift never surfaces":
     ★ ROOT CAUSE (the real one): get_stale_scored_items passed effective_hours=i64::MAX for SIGNAL
       users into `datetime('now','-'||?||' hours')`. SQLite OVERFLOWS that to NULL, so
       `created_at >= NULL` is never true → the query returned ZERO stale items for every Signal user.
       The live app is tier=signal, so the deep backlog (3828 stale items) was UNREACHABLE — the drain
       wasn't slow, it was empty. v5 only grew because the completion handler stamps recent items via
       normal scoring; the stale-drain itself never reached the backlog. LIVE-PROVEN via Victauri
       query_db: old signal predicate → 0 rows; new predicate → 3828 rows.
       Fix: for Signal (unlimited history) DROP the recency clause entirely (don't compute a giant
       offset). Free tier keeps the 30-day bound. Constant embedded (compile-time i64, no injection).
     • Fix 2 (ordering): drain was ORDER BY relevance DESC, but a version bump RESCUES items the old
       pipeline buried as noise (necessity try_stack_update_path: your own crates.io/npm release decayed
       to ~0). So relevance-DESC drained already-relevant items first, buried releases LAST. Now
       ORDER BY (content_type IN release_notes/platform_update) first, then relevance DESC. 583 stale
       releases (563 of them <0.3) now drain in the first 1-2 batches (500/run) instead of cycles 4-8.
       LIVE-PROVEN: first 12 of the new drain are all release_notes.
     • Fix 3 (fire on demand): extracted merge_stale_drain_batch() and ALSO call it on the full
       (non-differential) analysis path — previously the drain only ran in differential mode, so
       first-run-after-restart / manual run_cached_analysis never drained.
     Tests: 2 new in db::cache (release-first ordering; Signal no-overflow regression guard, returns
     1 not 0 for a 400-day-old item). Full lib compiles; clippy adds 0 new warnings; db::cache suite
     green. (analysis_status::abort_flag_resets_at_start is a pre-existing parallel-global-state flake —
     passes in isolation.) Files: src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs, src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs.
     Did NOT touch pre-existing Cargo.lock / untracked fourda-infer-proto/.gitignore.
     PUSHED: origin/main b0cf5a85..e9931ce9 (rev-list 0/0; pre-push full suite passed).
     END-TO-END LIVE-VERIFIED on a fresh rebuild+restart (killed old PID 52180, pnpm tauri dev):
     one run_cached_analysis (FULL path, last_completed_at=null → proves Fix 3 drains the full path):
       • v5: 524 → 931 (+407 backlog items drained in ONE run — was structurally 0 on Signal before).
       • stale release_notes: 583 → 259 (324 releases re-scored this run = 80% of the drained items,
         though releases are only ~15% of the backlog → release-first ordering working).
       • crates.io: axum v0.8.9 (opus-rescore-pipeline's exact buried example, was 0.17) → 0.644.
         npm react v19.2.7 → 0.909, crates.io tokio v1.52.3 → 0.893 — all rescued from noise.
       • necessity_category in actionable results: ecosystem_shift = 100 items (the category that
         "hadn't appeared yet" now surfaces). Left the new dev binary running. -->

     Two shipped fixes to make this session's scoring improvements reach the 35k backlog:
     • 168d41fc: bump PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5 (the stale-drain mechanism existed but my scoring
       changes never bumped the version → nothing was flagged stale).
     • b0cf5a85: NEW Database::mark_items_scored_version — stamp version for EVERY scored item.
       LIVE-FOUND via Victauri: drain stalled because persist filters top_score>0, so zero-score
       (noise) items were never stamped, stayed stale, and the relevance-ordered drain re-picked
       them forever.
     LIVE-VERIFIED via Victauri query_db: v5 bucket grew 0→437→467→524 across runs (drain works +
     progresses; stall fixed). NOT yet reached: ecosystem_shift items — the drain is relevance-DESC
     so low-relevance stack releases (axum @ 0.17) sit deep in the queue, AND per-run drain slowed
     after the initial 437 because the differential 500-batch stale-drain branch isn't firing in
     practice (diff=0 in logs across runs — last_completed_at/previous_results not establishing
     differential mode on manual invokes; the scheduler drains over time). That's the next refinement.
     Left dev server running (PID 1313). Did NOT touch topic-decay's files / Cargo.lock / .gitignore. -->

### Terminal: opus-rescore-pipeline (started 2026-06-04)
Working on: make this session's scoring improvements (necessity stack-update path, curated>synthesized
domain detection, ACE topic-noise filter, dep generic-word filter) reach the existing 35k-item backlog.
ROOT CAUSE: the stale-drain re-score mechanism already exists (get_stale_scored_items by
scored_pipeline_version < PIPELINE_VERSION, 500/run, ORDER BY relevance DESC) but my scoring changes
never bumped PIPELINE_VERSION (still 4) → nothing flagged stale → backlog never re-scored. Fix: bump 4→5.
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/scoring/mod.rs (PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5) — DONE/pushed (168d41fc)
- src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs (NEW mark_items_scored_version — stamp ALL scored items)
- src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs (stamp version for every scored item, not just top_score>0)
LIVE-FOUND BUG (via Victauri): drain stalled — zero-score items were never version-stamped
(persist filters top_score>0) so the relevance-ordered drain re-picked the same zero-scorers
forever; backlog could never fully drain past a band of zero-scorers. Fix stamps every scored item.
**Commit Lock**: not yet held.

     Phase 0 of the MARS-inspired decay work: the per-topic calibrated-freshness path
     (scoring::pipeline.rs:199) was DEAD in prod — autophagy::analyze_topic_decay keyed half-lives by
     source_type (hackernews/reddit) but the pipeline looks them up by extract_topics() tokens
     (rust/react) → keyspaces never intersect → every item fell back to the crude global staircase.
     Re-keyed the producer to bucket by the SAME crate::extract_topics() vocab (title+content;
     source_tags not persisted) + MIN_SAMPLES_PER_TOPIC=3 guard vs Phase-3 proper-noun noise.
     1 file (topic_decay.rs, +116/-25), 2 new tests (topic-keyed not source-keyed; low-sample skip).
     autophagy 76 + scoring 618 green; calibration golden baselines unmoved (consumer untouched);
     full pre-push gate passed. context.rs claim DROPPED (its :162 comment correctly describes the
     source_autopsy load below it; topic_half_lives is an accurate name after the rename).
     Live 4da.db = 0 feedback → 0 profiles, so the path was dormant HERE regardless; activates once
     engagement accrues. Phases 1-3 (unify kernel → closed-form multi-rate → per-user) STAGED, gated by
     intelligence-doctrine rule 10 (7-day dogfood). Strategy in memory project_decay_strategy_mars.md.

<!-- opus-ace-quality-domain (2026-06-04): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ 0af6e2d6, rev-list 0/0).
     Two domain-detection refinements on top of 7aea65e4, both forced by LIVE dogfood:
     • c96e22bf: weight ACE-inferred interests (cold-start users' interests are ACE-seeded source=Inferred).
     • 0af6e2d6: weight CURATED interests (explicit_interests, id=Some) > ACE-SYNTHESIZED (id=None). The repo's
       React frontend was synthesized into 5 web interests (react/typescript/javascript/next.js/express) that
       outvoted the 3 curated systems interests. id-based weighting fixes it.
     LIVE-VERIFIED on a guaranteed-fresh build: np flips web→systems (curated rust/tauri/axum win).
     ⚠ STALE-BINARY GOTCHA (cost ~40min): cargo kept NOT rebuilding after edits — running fourda.exe was
       OLDER than the commit, so warm reads showed the OLD web behavior. Fix: `touch src/probes_engine.rs &&
       cargo build` forces a real recompile (24s vs a bogus 1.5s up-to-date). Recipe saved.
     KEY FINDING (reported to user, NOT yet fixed — deeper than this scope): with honest systems targeting the
     calibration shows disc:1/recall:0 — the engine scores genuinely-relevant systems probes as noise
     ("Rust 2026 Edition" @ 0.257). PARTLY a probe-mode artifact (run_probe_calibration uses apply_signals:false,
     stricter than the real feed) — real feed DOES surface rust (Cargo advisory 0.6, Slumber TUI 0.535) but
     leans web (top item React/Next DoS 0.78). Candidate follow-ups: probe apply_signals:true to mirror feed;
     down-weight synthesized frontend interests in REAL feed scoring (not just domain detection).

     3 dogfood-found upstream quality fixes (the calibration numbers were honest, but the
     INPUTS were noisy and that noise degraded the live feed):
     (1) ACE topic noise → git.rs no longer emits commit-* topics + new high-precision
         is_low_quality_topic() gate (commit metadata, numeric/symbol fragments, camelCase
         code identifiers, <3 chars) applied at the interest-synthesis boundary AND auto-seed.
     (2) dep subterm false matches (winston-daily-rotate-file "matched" an AI paper via
         daily/rotate/file) → added generic words to COMMON_ENGLISH_WORDS; full name still matches.
     (3) domain mis-targeting (Rust/Tauri/Axum dev classified "web" → probe battery tested wrong
         domain) → detect_user_domain now lets explicit interests/onboarding tech dominate, weights
         auto-stacks low, caps ACE-topic breadth, recognises tauri/axum/wasm as systems.

     Skipper-recovery cold-start fix: the first-run PersonalizeNudge (shown when a user finished
     onboarding with no interests — typically a skipper) now offers a ONE-CLICK fully-local
     "Scan my projects" instead of only bouncing to Settings. Reuses the store's runAutoDiscovery
     (ace_auto_discover — the same proven path the onboarding choice gate uses), then loadUserContext
     (nudge auto-resolves once interests populate) + startAnalysis (re-scores the feed). Settings kept

     Phase 2 of the built-in LLM removal (backend) deferred by 25f0d945. ONE commit, built + validated
     in an isolated git worktree (dev server was live, would hot-reload mid-edit), then fast-forward merged.
     • Deleted llm_engine.rs (sidecar), model_manager.rs (GGUF catalog), settings_commands_llm/builtin.rs
       + the 7 builtin commands + lib.rs registrations + commands.ts contract.
     • Removed the `builtin` provider arm across the generation/capability stack (llm.rs, llm_stream.rs,
       llm_judgments.rs, ollama_capability.rs, ai_costs.rs, sovereign_developer_profile.rs,
       settings_commands.rs, health_checks.rs, 6 is_builtin_available guards, compute_has_llm) + the
       app_setup sidecar auto-start/shutdown. Dropped the llama-server-only StructuredOutputMode::Grammar
       variant + GBNF grammar — synthesis is JsonSchema for every provider now.
     • Migration: settings load resets persisted provider=="builtin" → "none" (manager_init.rs).
     • Frontend/locale: vestigial provider==='builtin' branches, 7 orphaned builtin-LLM locale keys ×13
       (built-in *embeddings* keys KEPT), sidecar error mapping. Removed 6 builtin victauri_dogfood tests
       + the builtin IPC-command assertions. .ai/FAILURE_MODES.md updated.
     • LANDMINES AVOIDED: blind_spots.rs/knowledge_decay.rs (Node.js builtin MODULES), calibration_*.rs/
       probes_engine.rs (fastembed embeddings, owned by opus-calibration-honesty-2), builtInSemantic* keys.
     Verified: cargo test --no-run (all compile), clippy adds 0 new warnings (4 remaining are pre-existing:
     domains/midpoint/sort_by), 3 compute_has_llm tests, tsc 0, 1260 frontend tests, validate:translations 0,
     27 script tests. Worktree + branch cleaned up. Did NOT touch pre-existing Cargo.lock / fourda-infer-proto/.gitignore. -->

     • HIGH fixed: signal-coverage axes fired from a DATA-EXISTENCE proxy (cached_context_count>0,
       active_topics non-empty) → replaced single-CVE audit_signal_axes with a BATTERY audit folded
       into run_probe_calibration (axis fires only when it crossed threshold on ≥1 of the 12
       real-embedding relevant probes). Removed proxy + one-probe volatility; unified two passes.
     • MEDIUM fixed: PersonaMetrics hardcoded fp:0/fn:0 → ProbeResults now carries real
       true_pos/false_pos/true_neg/false_neg; PersonaMetrics surfaces them.
     LIVE-VERIFIED (real profile, :7373): axes [context,interest,ace] → [context,interest,dependency]

     • test(doctrine) b607d6f6 — both gate scripts refactored to export their matcher (CLI/.husky
       behaviour unchanged, both still exit 0) + node:test suites (27) that pin catches AND known
       blind spots. New `pnpm run test:scripts`.

       stale-key false-positive class as P1 #3, surfaced by live verify.
     • Calibrate: active_signal_axes mapped to friendly labels ×13 (no raw context/ace IDs); P0/P1
       priority code → colored urgency dot. Stack %-badges left honest (only detected stacks get a %).
     • IMMUNE PASS: antibody 2026-06-02-proxy-derived-state.md (gitignored ops memory). Scan found the
       proxy-derived-state class in 4 MORE backend gates — all routed through the now-pub(crate)
       compute_has_llm (the single source of truth): content_translation_commands.rs (HIGH user-facing),

     The 5 P1 first-run "false-state lies" are fixed and COLD-START VERIFIED LIVE (fresh
     FOURDA_DATA_DIR throwaway instance, Victauri REST :7373):
     (1) calibrate "Setup complete" now says "Private semantic search active" (was the lie
         "AI provider configured" driven by embeddingMode) — screenshot-confirmed, old string gone.
     (2) Setup-complete tech/interest counts now from authoritative get_user_context (was
         optimistic store state); fresh profile correctly shows "No technologies / Default interests".
     (3) get_personalization_context_summary returns has_llm:false/llm_tier:"none" on no-provider
         (was true/"cloud" from a stale key) — live-invoke confirmed + unit test compute_has_llm.
     (4) removed the silent auto-pull of ollama models on "optional" setup mount; added explicit
         "Download required models" button (this machine's ollama was fully provisioned so the
         missing-model branch couldn't re-fire, but no auto-pull UI appears + path is gone).
     (5) provider mutual-exclusivity: Anthropic→1 key field, click Built-in→0 (key field hidden) — verified.
     Touched: context.rs, CalibrationStep.tsx, setup-ai-provider.tsx, use-quick-setup.ts,
     QuickSetupStep.tsx, locales/*/ui.json (13). Did NOT touch pre-existing Cargo.lock /

       • CalibrationStep.tsx: added `ONBOARDING_ACTIONABLE` const + gated the rec "Fix" button to
         it (give_feedback/open_settings_* now render as guidance, no dead button) + added a
         `result.grade_score < 70` day-one caption (t('calibration.onboarding.gradeStartingPoint')).
         Your authoritative-counts + honest-AI-line edits are a different region → should merge clean.
       • locales: I changed calibration.onboarding.summaryProjects/summaryNoProjects wording
         ("projects"→"technologies") and ADDED calibration.onboarding.gradeStartingPoint +
         language.change across all 13 locales. Your summaryAI rewording is a different key → clean.

       no command-name leak). Unit test green.
     • Wave 2 (3e65e382): builtin local-model sidecar auto-starts on launch when provider=="builtin" and a
       model is downloaded (app_setup.rs) — mirrors Ollama auto-warm, never auto-downloads, non-blocking.
     NOT DONE (handed to a fresh session — provider side, lower-priority follow-ups):
     • Surface the builtin local model IN onboarding (today it's Settings-only; only Ollama shows in the
       onboarding LOCAL section). BYOK is already the recommended/obvious onboarding option (green
       "Best accuracy" badge) — user confirmed BYOK should stay obvious + recommended, local = hybrid fallback.

- onboarding tests as needed (OnboardingChoiceGate.test.tsx)
- NOTE: app_setup.rs ACE startup logic UNCHANGED — we are NOT auto-scanning on skip (privacy). The
  scan is an explicit, consented, one-click choice at the gate.
- src/components/first-run/LoadingState.tsx (unique scan-ticker keys — fix dup rows)
- src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx layout (in-flow progress header — fix sun/heading overlap)
