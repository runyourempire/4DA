# Terminal Coordination

## Protocol
1. **Before editing**: Read this file. If your files are claimed by another terminal, STOP.
2. **Claim files**: Add your entry below with the files you'll touch.
3. **Commit Lock**: Set `**Commit Lock**: HELD` before committing. Only one terminal commits at a time.
4. **After committing**: Remove your entry and release the lock.
5. **Conflicts**: If two terminals touch the same file, the one that committed first wins. The other must rebase.

## Active Terminals

<!-- opus-preemption-cache (2026-06-06) WAVE 4 (#2b): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ 152c620e,
     522fe2ae..152c620e, rev-list 0/0; full pre-push gate green). Commit Lock RELEASED, claims cleared.
     Blind Spots now ranked by CONSEQUENCE not volume: count_signal_types_for_dep splits out
     security_advisory+breaking_change (were buried in "other"); title leads security>release>analysis;
     confidence consequence-weighted (sec +0.20/rel +0.12/analysis +0.06/pure-volume +0.0); urgency
     elevates security to ≥High and caps pure-volume at Medium. Tests: cap_urgency_at_medium_*,
     urgency_min_means_*. LIVE-VERIFIED: "react — 8 security/breaking-change signals unreviewed" (high,
     c=0.70) leads; release deps c=0.62; pure-volume sank to Medium. blind_spots.rs only. -->

### Terminal: opus-preemption-cache (2026-06-06) — WAVE 5 (#3: Knowledge Gaps substance gate)
Working on: ship Knowledge Gaps SILENT until substantive (verdict found it weak — 1 gap, headline an
obscure alpha crate). Gate get_knowledge_gaps to surface only gaps whose missed items include CONSEQUENCE
(security/breaking/version-update per existing classify_missed_item); pure relevant-discussion gaps ship
silent (doctrine rule 6). Also extend the headline highlight to prefer version-update (never fall back to
an alpha-crate via missed.first()). BACKEND-ONLY (knowledge_decay.rs).
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/knowledge_decay.rs (get_knowledge_gaps substance gate + build_gap_explanation highlight)
**Commit Lock**: HELD (opus-preemption-cache) — committing #3 Knowledge Gaps substance gate (knowledge_decay.rs only).

### Terminal: opus-signal-grounding (2026-06-06) — signal_chains grounding (measure-first)
Working on: the last grounding gap. signal_chains can mint a CRITICAL keyword-security alert for a topic
the user does NOT depend on (verified_dep=None → priority "critical", conf 0.32, into Preemption, action
"…in your projects" when it isn't). Bounded fix: keyword-inferred security/breaking only escalate to
critical/alert when the chain affects an installed dep; ungrounded chains capped below the grounded band
(awareness-only urgency + honest action copy). BACKEND-ONLY (signal_chains.rs) — zero overlap with
@opus-preemption-cache's blind_spots.rs. Live-measured first: 0 live chains now (preventive hardening).
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/signal_chains.rs (detect_chains priority/confidence gating + suggested_action honesty)
**Commit Lock**: not held (waiting for @opus-preemption-cache to release before staging signal_chains.rs only).

<!-- opus-tab-quality (2026-06-06) WAVE 4: DONE — i18n backend-leak refactor PHASE 1 (frontend-only)
     COMPLETE + PUSHED. Increment 1 @ 22be99b7 (urgency enum → preemption.urgency.* keys [durable/offline]
     + wired useTranslatedContent for titles+explanations on PreemptionCard/StackCoverageMap) and
     Increment 2 @ 522fe2ae (version-context citation + relevance notes) — both on origin/main, 0/0 sync,
     gate green. Net: every dynamic string on the Preemption + Blind Spots tabs now routes through the
     app's translation path (LLM catch-all, parity with Briefing; English path byte-identical). 2 frontend
     files, tsc/eslint/31-tests green each. Action-label CODE→KEY + structured relevance_note keys deferred
     to Phase 3/4 (BACKEND — blind_spots.rs/preemption.rs/knowledge_decay.rs) per the plan; those need the
     EvidenceItem reason_code/params schema field (Phase 0.5/5) and are gated behind the active backend
     terminals. Increment 1's push was briefly blocked by @opus-preemption-cache's unformatted blind_spots.rs
     (foreign WIP, not mine — resolved when they fmt+committed @ 69590cf6). Commit Lock RELEASED, claims cleared.

     Closed the feed-cache v1 caveat: re-warm the Preemption cache after EVERY OSV sync so it never
     serves pre-sync advisories. Boot sync block folds the warm in (eager-warm when recently synced,
     post-sync warm otherwise — once per boot, removed the standalone +8s task); osv_sync_now spawns
     a background re-warm. LIVE-VERIFIED: first call after restart 20ms (warm via recently-synced

     Blind Spots volume → consequence: titles now lead with what CHANGED, not the unread count —
     "react — 17 new releases unreviewed" / "axum — 16 new releases unreviewed" / "typescript — 25
     release updates unreviewed" (uncovered_dep + stale_topic), soft "N updates to review" fallback.
     LATENT BUG FIXED: count_signal_types_for_dep + lookup_installed_version were passed the DISPLAY
     name ("react (npm)") but match article titles via LIKE (never carry the " (ecosystem)" qualifier)
     → always returned 0, so the consequence breakdown had NEVER fired for any dep. New bare_package_name()
     strips it; confirmed live (react had 17 release_notes/11 deep_dive/7 security_advisory invisible
     before). Test bare_package_name_strips_ecosystem_qualifier. LIVE-VERIFIED via bridge. blind_spots.rs

     Commit Lock RELEASED, claims cleared. 2 NEW slice tests (8 cases) pinning the AB-011 paywall

       Also: i18n backend-leak refactor plan staged at .claude/plans/i18n-backend-leak-refactor.md
       (Phase 1 frontend-only is unblocked; Phase 4 preemption.rs blocked by opus-preemption-cache).
       NOTE @opus-preemption-cache WAVE 3 (Blind Spots title reframing, blind_spots.rs): when your
       backend retitles uncovered/stale items, it does NOT affect my frontend paywall/CTA path — but
       it WILL feed the i18n Phase-3 plan (blind_spots.rs titles → template keys). Coordinate there. -->

<!-- opus-preemption-cache (2026-06-06): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ 42097071,

     Preemption-tab first-paint latency (cold-start work item A). MEASURED first, fixed second: the
     returning-user data is PRESENT at boot (matches computed live from persisted advisories + deps),
     but get_preemption_alerts took 30-40s on every call — live OSV matching + an adversarial LLM
     deliberation (one call per Medium/Watch item). (The earlier "empty on cold start" reading was a
     wrong-command artifact: get_preemption_FEED doesn't exist → 51-char error misread as an empty feed.)
     Fix v1 (preemption.rs + app_setup.rs, +230/-10): in-process EvidenceFeed cache (once_cell Lazy +
     parking_lot Mutex, 10-min TTL, stale-while-revalidate, lock cloned+dropped before await); extracted
     compute_preemption_evidence_feed() shared by the command + warm path (Signal gate stays at the
     serving boundary); warm_preemption_cache() spawned off the boot path (+8s) so the first tab-open is a
     cache hit. 1 test (feed_cache_stores_and_serves_within_ttl). LIVE-VERIFIED: 30-40s -> 230ms first
     (warmed) hit, 7-12ms thereafter, 12 OSV alerts intact. NOT a dup of 308c3841 ("always-on Preemption"
     = the BRIEF's security section; this is the Preemption TAB latency — different files, complementary).
     v1 caveat in code: a >6h-stale boot that triggers a fresh OSV sync may serve pre-sync advisories until
     the TTL elapses — next lever = invalidate-on-sync. Did NOT touch AdapterStatus.ts / fourda-infer-proto. -->

     Immune-scan antibody AB-011 caught the c5f058a5 Preemption paywall bug hiding unfixed in the
     sibling Blind Spots tab (get_blind_spots Signal-gated → translateError → red "Something went
     wrong" banner for free-tier users). Fix (18 files): CENTRALIZED the gate classifier as
     isSignalGateError in utils/error-messages (single source of truth; preemption-slice drops its
     local copy, blind-spots-slice adopts it) + error-messages.test.ts (7 contract tests = the AB-011

     3 doctrine-audit tab fixes (18 files, +124/-17): (1) Blind Spots ScoreBar fill now tracks
     `pressure` not `100-pressure` — number/magnitude/color agree (live-verified score 28 → bar 28%);

     Resumed the stuck "Evaluate morning brief" loop; finished the eval and fixed the real bug it
     would have missed: the AI Brief hallucinated by FALSE ATTRIBUTION (welded a global axios/npm CVE
     onto the user's Axum/Rust backend), fabricated a "51-hour blackout" from a benign stale-file
     anomaly, manufactured PAT-theft urgency, and self-reinforced via the briefing-seal continuity
     loop. Root cause: brief synthesized free-form prose from raw content items + a tech-stack string
     with NO grounding, while the deterministic dep-scoped Preemption truth was never given to it.
     Fix in digest_commands.rs (1 file, +93/-5): lever 1 (drop StaleData anomalies from brief context),
     lever 2 (build_grounded_security_section -> CONFIRMED SECURITY block from OSV-verified dep-scoped
     Preemption feed; system-prompt makes it the SOLE security source; CVE news -> awareness only),
     lever 3 (system-prompt: continuity/seal context is thematic-only, ban briefing meta-commentary +
     internal command-name labels). KEY INSIGHT: Option-A system-prompt guardrails ALONE were verified
     INSUFFICIENT — the brief is broken by INJECTED context, so a system rule loses to user-prompt
     content that asserts the bad facts. LIVE-VERIFIED across 3 rebuilds / ~7 regenerations: every
     dangerous defect gone; Action Required now = real OSV vulns scoped to the right projects. Push

<!-- opus-stale-drain-ordering (2026-06-05): DONE — committed locally (push held for user).
     Completed the refinements opus-rescore-pipeline deferred. While verifying, found a THIRD,
     BIGGER root cause that subsumes "the drain doesn't fire" / "ecosystem_shift never surfaces":
     ★ ROOT CAUSE (the real one): get_stale_scored_items passed effective_hours=i64::MAX for SIGNAL
       users into `datetime('now','-'||?||' hours')`. SQLite OVERFLOWS that to NULL, so
       `created_at >= NULL` is never true → the query returned ZERO stale items for every Signal user.
       The live app is tier=signal, so the deep backlog (3828 stale items) was UNREACHABLE — the drain
       wasn't slow, it was empty. v5 only grew because the completion handler stamps recent items via
       normal scoring; the stale-drain itself never reached the backlog. LIVE-PROVEN via Victauri
       query_db: old signal predicate → 0 rows; new predicate → 3828 rows.
       Fix: for Signal (unlimited history) DROP the recency clause entirely (don't compute a giant
       offset). Free tier keeps the 30-day bound. Constant embedded (compile-time i64, no injection).
     • Fix 2 (ordering): drain was ORDER BY relevance DESC, but a version bump RESCUES items the old
       pipeline buried as noise (necessity try_stack_update_path: your own crates.io/npm release decayed
       to ~0). So relevance-DESC drained already-relevant items first, buried releases LAST. Now
       ORDER BY (content_type IN release_notes/platform_update) first, then relevance DESC. 583 stale
       releases (563 of them <0.3) now drain in the first 1-2 batches (500/run) instead of cycles 4-8.
       LIVE-PROVEN: first 12 of the new drain are all release_notes.
     • Fix 3 (fire on demand): extracted merge_stale_drain_batch() and ALSO call it on the full
       (non-differential) analysis path — previously the drain only ran in differential mode, so
       first-run-after-restart / manual run_cached_analysis never drained.
     Tests: 2 new in db::cache (release-first ordering; Signal no-overflow regression guard, returns
     1 not 0 for a 400-day-old item). Full lib compiles; clippy adds 0 new warnings; db::cache suite
     green. (analysis_status::abort_flag_resets_at_start is a pre-existing parallel-global-state flake —
     passes in isolation.) Files: src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs, src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs.

     END-TO-END LIVE-VERIFIED on a fresh rebuild+restart (killed old PID 52180, pnpm tauri dev):
     one run_cached_analysis (FULL path, last_completed_at=null → proves Fix 3 drains the full path):
       • v5: 524 → 931 (+407 backlog items drained in ONE run — was structurally 0 on Signal before).
       • stale release_notes: 583 → 259 (324 releases re-scored this run = 80% of the drained items,
         though releases are only ~15% of the backlog → release-first ordering working).
       • crates.io: axum v0.8.9 (opus-rescore-pipeline's exact buried example, was 0.17) → 0.644.
         npm react v19.2.7 → 0.909, crates.io tokio v1.52.3 → 0.893 — all rescued from noise.

     Two shipped fixes to make this session's scoring improvements reach the 35k backlog:
     • 168d41fc: bump PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5 (the stale-drain mechanism existed but my scoring
       changes never bumped the version → nothing was flagged stale).
     • b0cf5a85: NEW Database::mark_items_scored_version — stamp version for EVERY scored item.
       LIVE-FOUND via Victauri: drain stalled because persist filters top_score>0, so zero-score
       (noise) items were never stamped, stayed stale, and the relevance-ordered drain re-picked
       them forever.
     LIVE-VERIFIED via Victauri query_db: v5 bucket grew 0→437→467→524 across runs (drain works +
     progresses; stall fixed). NOT yet reached: ecosystem_shift items — the drain is relevance-DESC
     so low-relevance stack releases (axum @ 0.17) sit deep in the queue, AND per-run drain slowed
     after the initial 437 because the differential 500-batch stale-drain branch isn't firing in
     practice (diff=0 in logs across runs — last_completed_at/previous_results not establishing
     differential mode on manual invokes; the scheduler drains over time). That's the next refinement.

### Terminal: opus-rescore-pipeline (started 2026-06-04)
Working on: make this session's scoring improvements (necessity stack-update path, curated>synthesized
domain detection, ACE topic-noise filter, dep generic-word filter) reach the existing 35k-item backlog.
ROOT CAUSE: the stale-drain re-score mechanism already exists (get_stale_scored_items by
scored_pipeline_version < PIPELINE_VERSION, 500/run, ORDER BY relevance DESC) but my scoring changes
never bumped PIPELINE_VERSION (still 4) → nothing flagged stale → backlog never re-scored. Fix: bump 4→5.
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/scoring/mod.rs (PIPELINE_VERSION 4→5) — DONE/pushed (168d41fc)
- src-tauri/src/db/cache.rs (NEW mark_items_scored_version — stamp ALL scored items)
- src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs (stamp version for every scored item, not just top_score>0)
LIVE-FOUND BUG (via Victauri): drain stalled — zero-score items were never version-stamped
(persist filters top_score>0) so the relevance-ordered drain re-picked the same zero-scorers
forever; backlog could never fully drain past a band of zero-scorers. Fix stamps every scored item.

     Phase 0 of the MARS-inspired decay work: the per-topic calibrated-freshness path
     (scoring::pipeline.rs:199) was DEAD in prod — autophagy::analyze_topic_decay keyed half-lives by
     source_type (hackernews/reddit) but the pipeline looks them up by extract_topics() tokens
     (rust/react) → keyspaces never intersect → every item fell back to the crude global staircase.
     Re-keyed the producer to bucket by the SAME crate::extract_topics() vocab (title+content;
     source_tags not persisted) + MIN_SAMPLES_PER_TOPIC=3 guard vs Phase-3 proper-noun noise.
     1 file (topic_decay.rs, +116/-25), 2 new tests (topic-keyed not source-keyed; low-sample skip).
     autophagy 76 + scoring 618 green; calibration golden baselines unmoved (consumer untouched);
     full pre-push gate passed. context.rs claim DROPPED (its :162 comment correctly describes the
     source_autopsy load below it; topic_half_lives is an accurate name after the rename).
     Live 4da.db = 0 feedback → 0 profiles, so the path was dormant HERE regardless; activates once
     engagement accrues. Phases 1-3 (unify kernel → closed-form multi-rate → per-user) STAGED, gated by

<!-- opus-ace-quality-domain (2026-06-04): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ 0af6e2d6, rev-list 0/0).
     Two domain-detection refinements on top of 7aea65e4, both forced by LIVE dogfood:
     • c96e22bf: weight ACE-inferred interests (cold-start users' interests are ACE-seeded source=Inferred).
     • 0af6e2d6: weight CURATED interests (explicit_interests, id=Some) > ACE-SYNTHESIZED (id=None). The repo's
       React frontend was synthesized into 5 web interests (react/typescript/javascript/next.js/express) that
       outvoted the 3 curated systems interests. id-based weighting fixes it.
     LIVE-VERIFIED on a guaranteed-fresh build: np flips web→systems (curated rust/tauri/axum win).
     ⚠ STALE-BINARY GOTCHA (cost ~40min): cargo kept NOT rebuilding after edits — running fourda.exe was
       OLDER than the commit, so warm reads showed the OLD web behavior. Fix: `touch src/probes_engine.rs &&
       cargo build` forces a real recompile (24s vs a bogus 1.5s up-to-date). Recipe saved.
     KEY FINDING (reported to user, NOT yet fixed — deeper than this scope): with honest systems targeting the
     calibration shows disc:1/recall:0 — the engine scores genuinely-relevant systems probes as noise
     ("Rust 2026 Edition" @ 0.257). PARTLY a probe-mode artifact (run_probe_calibration uses apply_signals:false,
     stricter than the real feed) — real feed DOES surface rust (Cargo advisory 0.6, Slumber TUI 0.535) but
     leans web (top item React/Next DoS 0.78). Candidate follow-ups: probe apply_signals:true to mirror feed;
     down-weight synthesized frontend interests in REAL feed scoring (not just domain detection).

     3 dogfood-found upstream quality fixes (the calibration numbers were honest, but the
     INPUTS were noisy and that noise degraded the live feed):
     (1) ACE topic noise → git.rs no longer emits commit-* topics + new high-precision
         is_low_quality_topic() gate (commit metadata, numeric/symbol fragments, camelCase
         code identifiers, <3 chars) applied at the interest-synthesis boundary AND auto-seed.
     (2) dep subterm false matches (winston-daily-rotate-file "matched" an AI paper via
         daily/rotate/file) → added generic words to COMMON_ENGLISH_WORDS; full name still matches.
     (3) domain mis-targeting (Rust/Tauri/Axum dev classified "web" → probe battery tested wrong
         domain) → detect_user_domain now lets explicit interests/onboarding tech dominate, weights
         auto-stacks low, caps ACE-topic breadth, recognises tauri/axum/wasm as systems.
     Tests: low_quality_topic matrix, winston sub-term exclusion, explicit-interests-beat-web-breadth.

     Skipper-recovery cold-start fix: the first-run PersonalizeNudge (shown when a user finished
     onboarding with no interests — typically a skipper) now offers a ONE-CLICK fully-local
     "Scan my projects" instead of only bouncing to Settings. Reuses the store's runAutoDiscovery
     (ace_auto_discover — the same proven path the onboarding choice gate uses), then loadUserContext
     (nudge auto-resolves once interests populate) + startAnalysis (re-scores the feed). Settings kept
     as secondary; card stays dismissible; dismiss disabled mid-scan. Explicit click = consent (INV-004).
     NOTE: the bigger lever (in-session scan during onboarding) was ALREADY shipped by opus-provider-side

     • Deleted llm_engine.rs (sidecar), model_manager.rs (GGUF catalog), settings_commands_llm/builtin.rs
       + the 7 builtin commands + lib.rs registrations + commands.ts contract.
     • Removed the `builtin` provider arm across the generation/capability stack (llm.rs, llm_stream.rs,

       app_setup sidecar auto-start/shutdown. Dropped the llama-server-only StructuredOutputMode::Grammar
       variant + GBNF grammar — synthesis is JsonSchema for every provider now.
     • Migration: settings load resets persisted provider=="builtin" → "none" (manager_init.rs).
     • Frontend/locale: vestigial provider==='builtin' branches, 7 orphaned builtin-LLM locale keys ×13
       (built-in *embeddings* keys KEPT), sidecar error mapping. Removed 6 builtin victauri_dogfood tests
       + the builtin IPC-command assertions. .ai/FAILURE_MODES.md updated.

     P2 polish (aed3ee7e) + AOS immune pass (851fa416), all cold-start verified:
     • Choice-gate stray "AI Provider" chip → shown only when genuinely configured. BONUS: caught +
       fixed Onboarding.tsx hasProviderConfigured (has_api_key||ollama → provider-driven) — same
       stale-key false-positive class as P1 #3, surfaced by live verify.
     • Calibrate: active_signal_axes mapped to friendly labels ×13 (no raw context/ace IDs); P0/P1
       priority code → colored urgency dot. Stack %-badges left honest (only detected stacks get a %).
     • IMMUNE PASS: antibody 2026-06-02-proxy-derived-state.md (gitignored ops memory). Scan found the
       proxy-derived-state class in 4 MORE backend gates — all routed through the now-pub(crate)
       compute_has_llm (the single source of truth): content_translation_commands.rs (HIGH user-facing),
       monitoring_jobs.rs, digest_commands.rs, content_commands.rs. Also fixed inverse builtin
       false-negative. immuneScanPending cleared. cargo test + 36 onboarding tests + tsc/eslint green.
     Open follow-up (lower priority): picking Built-in doesn't persist provider="builtin" unless the
     user downloads+starts the model — see memory project_first_run_signal_trial.md. -->

     The 5 P1 first-run "false-state lies" are fixed and COLD-START VERIFIED LIVE (fresh
     FOURDA_DATA_DIR throwaway instance, Victauri REST :7373):
     (1) calibrate "Setup complete" now says "Private semantic search active" (was the lie
         "AI provider configured" driven by embeddingMode) — screenshot-confirmed, old string gone.
     (2) Setup-complete tech/interest counts now from authoritative get_user_context (was
         optimistic store state); fresh profile correctly shows "No technologies / Default interests".
     (3) get_personalization_context_summary returns has_llm:false/llm_tier:"none" on no-provider
         (was true/"cloud" from a stale key) — live-invoke confirmed + unit test compute_has_llm.
     (4) removed the silent auto-pull of ollama models on "optional" setup mount; added explicit
         "Download required models" button (this machine's ollama was fully provisioned so the
         missing-model branch couldn't re-fire, but no auto-pull UI appears + path is gone).
     (5) provider mutual-exclusivity: Anthropic→1 key field, click Built-in→0 (key field hidden) — verified.
     Touched: context.rs, CalibrationStep.tsx, setup-ai-provider.tsx, use-quick-setup.ts,
     QuickSetupStep.tsx, locales/*/ui.json (13). Did NOT touch pre-existing Cargo.lock /
     untracked fourda-infer-proto/.gitignore. P2 polish (stray "AI Provider" gate heading,
     "P1" internal-ID leak on calibrate rec, stack %-badges) still open — see memory. -->


<!-- opus-calibration-honesty (2026-06-02): DONE — committed + pushed (origin/main @ 8c88032e,

     ⚠ @opus-p1-false-state: WE OVERLAP on src/components/onboarding/CalibrationStep.tsx and
     src/locales/*/ui.json — I landed FIRST (8c88032e), so please rebase/pull and PRESERVE my
     edits, don't clobber them:
       • CalibrationStep.tsx: added `ONBOARDING_ACTIONABLE` const + gated the rec "Fix" button to
         it (give_feedback/open_settings_* now render as guidance, no dead button) + added a
         `result.grade_score < 70` day-one caption (t('calibration.onboarding.gradeStartingPoint')).
         Your authoritative-counts + honest-AI-line edits are a different region → should merge clean.
       • locales: I changed calibration.onboarding.summaryProjects/summaryNoProjects wording
         ("projects"→"technologies") and ADDED calibration.onboarding.gradeStartingPoint +
         language.change across all 13 locales. Your summaryAI rewording is a different key → clean.
     Backend (calibration_commands.rs / calibration_probes.rs / probes_engine.rs): real-embedding
     discrimination+audit, provider-agnostic embedding_available (built-in fastembed no longer 0 infra),
     real hardware_detect GPU/RAM, interest diminishing-returns, + deterministic regression test.
     All gates green (tsc/eslint/13-locale i18n/10 probe tests/full pre-push). No lock held. -->


### Terminal: opus-scoring-accuracy (started 2026-05-31)
Working on: scoring accuracy — P0 search relevance (RRF-normalize→true semantic cosine), P1 stale
re-score trigger decoupling. Coordinating on analyzer.rs (owned by scan-fixes) — will NOT touch it.
**Claims:**
- src-tauri/src/db/hybrid_search.rs (surface vec distance)
- src-tauri/src/natural_language_search_engine.rs (relevance = semantic cosine, not rank-ratio)
- src-tauri/src/analysis_status.rs (P1: decouple stale re-score from new_items.is_empty)
**Commit Lock**: RELEASED (opus-scoring-accuracy) — P0 search relevance + P1 stale-drain pushed;
deep-link off-feed "inspect" fix committed locally (c19aa110), push held to avoid build contention.
Apology + correction re the cargo-fmt/git-checkout incident recorded; will never run cargo fmt
(whole tree) or git checkout/reset/stash on this shared tree again.

### Terminal: opus-scan-fixes (started 2026-05-31)
Working on: scan-driven fixes (scoring ceiling, dep-alert normalization, API key UX/telemetry, briefing prompt).
**Wave 1 claims:**
- src-tauri/src/db/dependencies/alerts.rs (severity/ecosystem normalization)
- src-tauri/src/scoring/pipeline_v2.rs (score ceiling soft-spread)
- src-tauri/src/scoring/mod.rs (PIPELINE_VERSION bump)
- src-tauri/src/settings/manager.rs (api key trim)
- src-tauri/src/settings/settings_commands_llm/mod.rs (key trim/validate)
- src-tauri/src/digest_commands.rs (actionable error message)
- src-tauri/src/analysis_rerank.rs (honest failed-call telemetry)
- src-tauri/src/monitoring_briefing.rs (briefing prompt: title refs not index)
- src-tauri/src/embeddings_providers/fastembed.rs (dynamic-quant batching regression fix)
- (no frontend files touched — all fixes are backend Rust; error banner is backend-sourced)
- STATUS: 4 commits landed locally (d10d59f8 embeddings, 28130912 scoring, 5d6fb063 alerts,
  968da2e0 llm/briefing); all pre-commit gates passed; backend test suites green.
- ⚠ PUSH BLOCKED by pre-push `tsc`: errors are entirely in opus-command-search's UNTRACKED
  src/components/search/* WIP (command-search-*.ts, CommandSearch.tsx, use-command-search.ts)
  + platform.ts. Not my files — won't touch. My commits push cleanly once those typecheck.
  @opus-command-search: please get search/* + platform.ts tsc-clean so the shared gate passes.
**Commit Lock**: RELEASED (committing complete; awaiting clean working tree to push)
- ✅ RESOLVED by opus-command-search: search/* + platform.ts are committed (e2a2ee17, plus a 1-line
  tweak swept into c37baa15) and fully tsc-clean — typecheck 0, ESLint 0, file-sizes 0, 13/13 tests
  green, live-verified via Victauri. The pre-push tsc gate is unblocked; safe to push.

<!-- opus-provider-side (2026-06-01): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ 3e65e382, 13d5efbe..3e65e382).
     Commit Lock RELEASED, claims cleared. Provider-side skip-setup cold-start fixes shipped & verified:
     • Wave 1 (d06e697a): instant 14-day Signal reverse-trial auto-starts on first launch
       (manager_init.rs) — VERIFIED live via cold-start FOURDA_DATA_DIR: 4da::license log line fired +
       settings.json wrote trial_started_at, tier=free, empty license. Graceful no-provider (llm.rs, all
       5 paths — no more raw "Unknown provider: none"). Clean paywall (gating.rs signal_feature_label —
       no command-name leak). Unit test green.
     • Wave 2 (3e65e382): builtin local-model sidecar auto-starts on launch when provider=="builtin" and a
       model is downloaded (app_setup.rs) — mirrors Ollama auto-warm, never auto-downloads, non-blocking.
     NOT DONE (handed to a fresh session — provider side, lower-priority follow-ups):
     • Surface the builtin local model IN onboarding (today it's Settings-only; only Ollama shows in the
       onboarding LOCAL section). BYOK is already the recommended/obvious onboarding option (green
       "Best accuracy" badge) — user confirmed BYOK should stay obvious + recommended, local = hybrid fallback.
     • ACE in-session auto-discovery on skip (app_setup.rs:1935 defers to next launch) — the biggest lever
       for "0 relevant"/uniform-23% on empty profile. The *profile* side of cold-start (vs provider side).
     • NOTE: screenshots 2827/2828 were a STALE build — current code already routes HealthBanner via
       friendlyError() and Preemption/BlindSpots via ProGate; live-verify those render clean before any edits. -->

### Terminal: opus-provider-side (2026-06-01) — Wave 1-2 pushed (see comment above). NOW: Wave 3 ACE in-session.
Working on: ACE in-session auto-discovery on skip (the PROFILE side of cold-start — biggest lever for
"0 relevant"/uniform-23%) + (paired) surface built-in local model in onboarding LOCAL section.
**Wave 3 claims (consent-based ACE + onboarding local model — NOT auto-scan; INV-004 respected):**
- src/components/onboarding/OnboardingChoiceGate.tsx (add recommended "Scan my projects — 100% local" path)
- src/components/Onboarding.tsx (handleScanAndComplete → ace_auto_discover then complete)
- src/components/onboarding/setup-ai-provider.tsx (surface built-in local model in LOCAL section)
- src/locales/en/ui.json + src/types/i18n-resources.d.ts (new onboarding keys; rely on fallbackLng=en)
- onboarding tests as needed (OnboardingChoiceGate.test.tsx)
- NOTE: app_setup.rs ACE startup logic UNCHANGED — we are NOT auto-scanning on skip (privacy). The
  scan is an explicit, consented, one-click choice at the gate.
- src/components/first-run/LoadingState.tsx (unique scan-ticker keys — fix dup rows)
- src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx layout (in-flow progress header — fix sun/heading overlap)
- src-tauri/src/ace_commands/scanning.rs (single-flight guard on ace_auto_discover — fix 92% stall)
**Commit Lock**: RELEASED (opus-provider-side) — Wave 3 committed: cf5dcc79 (consent gate + builtin
card + overlap fix) + 3468c4ce (single-flight ACE guard + unique ticker keys). All gates green.
Doing final live verify (layout overlap + stall-free single scan), then push. NOT pushed yet.

<!-- opus-onboarding-scrollbar (2026-06-01): DONE — committed + PUSHED (origin/main @ bf04e3b4).
     Dead root scrollbar behind the first-run overlays (splash + onboarding): documentElement
