//! `fourda-engine` — headless 4DA refresh engine.
//!
//! Runs the same fetch+score pipeline as the desktop app, but with no window, so the SQLite
//! database stays fresh for the MCP server even when the GUI isn't open. This is a console
//! binary (no `windows_subsystem = "windows"`) so a Task Scheduler / cron job — or an external
//! verifier re-running it as a proof — sees its stdout and exit code.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   fourda-engine            run one refresh cycle if data is stale, then exit (default)
//!   fourda-engine --once     same as above (explicit)
//!   fourda-engine --daemon   run continuously on the monitoring interval until Ctrl-C
//!   fourda-engine --force    refresh even if data is already fresh (combine with --once/--daemon)
//!   fourda-engine --help     print usage and exit 0
//!
//! Without `--force`, a cycle is skipped when the data is already fresh (last fetch within the
//! refresh interval), so running alongside an active GUI does not double-fetch rate-limited sources.
//!
//! Exit codes (--once): 0 = success or skipped-fresh, 1 = scoring failed, 2 = app build failed,
//! 64 = bad usage.
