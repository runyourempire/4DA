# 4DA Improvement Plan — Bulletproof Edition

## The Diagnosis

The codebase has strong bones but carries significant dead weight. The numbers:

| Metric | Value | Verdict |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Tauri commands defined | 134 | |
| Tauri commands called from frontend | 34 | **100 dead commands (75%)** |
| Rust events emitted | 17 | |
| Rust events listened to in frontend | 2 | **15 orphaned events (88%)** |
| DB tables (main + ACE) | 17 + 22 = 39 | Need usage audit |
| Compiler warnings | 1 | Good |
| Production `unwrap()` calls | ~5-8 | Each one is a crash risk |
| Frontend test coverage | 49 tests / 30+ components | Thin |
| Frontend state systems | 2 (hooks + Zustand) | Dual state = bugs |

The scoring engine, source adapters, and domain intelligence are solid. The problem isn't quality — it's **surface area**. 100 dead commands means 100 functions that could break, need updating, and confuse anyone reading the code.

---

## Phase 1: Cut the Dead Weight

**Goal:** Remove everything that isn't wired end-to-end. If it has no UI and no MCP consumer, it's dead code.

### 1.1 — Kill Unused Tauri Commands

The MCP server reads SQLite directly — it does NOT call Tauri commands. So any command not called from frontend JS is truly dead.

**100 commands to evaluate.** Group by module:

| Module | Commands | Used | Dead |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| `ace_commands.rs` (1,690 lines) | 35 | 3 (record_interaction, resolve_anomaly, save_watcher_state) | **32** |
| `commands.rs` (825 lines) | ~15 | ~10 | ~5 |
| `context_commands.rs` | ~8 | 3 | ~5 |
| `digest_commands.rs` | ~5 | 0 | **5** |
| `monitoring_commands.rs` | ~5 | 3 | ~2 |
| `job_queue_commands.rs` | ~4 | 0 | **4** |
| `void_commands.rs` | ~2 | 0 | **2** |
| `settings_commands.rs` | ~20 | ~15 | ~5 |
| Other scattered files | ~40 | 0 | **~40** |

**Action:** For each dead command:
1. Check if it's called internally by other Rust code (some commands call each other)
2. If pure dead-end → delete the `#[tauri::command]` wrapper AND remove from `generate_handler![]` in `lib.rs`
3. Keep the underlying logic function if it's used internally (just kill the command wrapper)

**Expected result:** ~3,000-5,000 lines removed. `ace_commands.rs` alone drops from 1,690 to ~200.

### 1.2 — Kill Orphaned Events

17 events emitted, 2 listened to. The orphaned 15:

```
ace-scan-complete, ace-scan-error, ace-scan-started, ace-watcher-started,
analysis-complete, analysis-error, analysis-progress, background-results,
cache-updated, embedding-mode, monitoring-toggled, source-error,
start-analysis-from-tray, tray-analyze, tray-toggle-monitoring
```

**Decision per event:**
- `analysis-complete`, `analysis-progress`, `analysis-error`, `background-results` → These SHOULD be wired up. The frontend polls instead of listening. **Wire them up** (Phase 3).
- `cache-updated`, `embedding-mode`, `monitoring-toggled` → Wire to Zustand store updates
- `ace-scan-*`, `ace-watcher-*` → Dead if ACE commands are dead. **Delete with ACE cleanup**
- `tray-*`, `start-analysis-from-tray` → Tray menu events. Keep if tray menu exists, kill if not.

### 1.3 — Audit ACE Module

ACE (`ace/`) is 5,285 lines with its own DB (22 tables), its own embedding system, its own file watcher. Only 3 of its 35 commands are called from the frontend.

**Question:** Is ACE actually used in the scoring pipeline?

Check: Does `scoring/ace_context.rs` read from ACE's DB tables? If yes, ACE's *data* is live but its *commands* are dead. If no, the entire module might be dormant.

**Action:** Audit `ace_context.rs` → determine if ACE feeds into scoring. If it does, keep the internals but kill the 32 dead commands. If it doesn't, consider gating the entire module behind a feature flag.

### 1.4 — Audit DB Tables

39 tables is a lot. For each table:
- Is it written to by active code paths?
- Is it read by scoring, analysis, or MCP?
- If neither → drop from migrations (don't delete data, just stop creating)

---

## Phase 2: Harden What Remains

### 2.1 — Fix Production `unwrap()` Calls

Known locations:
- `analysis.rs:939` — `last_completed_at.as_deref().unwrap()` → use `unwrap_or("")` or `?`
- `analysis.rs:1038` — `previous_results.unwrap()` → use `unwrap_or_default()` or `?`
- Any remaining in non-test code after Phase 1 cleanup

**Rule:** Zero `unwrap()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`. Use `?`, `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_default`, or `if let`.

### 2.2 — Clone Audit on Hot Paths

333 `clone()` calls total. Not all matter. Focus on the hot paths:

- `scoring/mod.rs` — called for every item. 2 clones = fine.
- `source_fetching.rs` — 22 clones. This runs per-source. Audit for `Arc` or `&str` opportunities.
- `analysis.rs` — 30 clones. This is the main analysis loop. Worth optimizing.

**Action:** Profile the analysis loop. If a single analysis takes <2s, skip this. If >5s, audit the 30 clones in `analysis.rs`.

### 2.3 — Error Propagation Audit

Grep for `let _ =` (silently swallowed errors) and `if let Ok(...)` (ignoring error branch). Count them. For critical paths (scoring, fetching, DB writes), ensure errors propagate or are logged.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Architecture

### 3.1 — Resolve Dual State

The app has 11 hooks (`use-*.ts`) AND a Zustand store with 11 slices. `App.tsx` imports both. This means:
- Some state lives in hooks (local to App)
- Some state lives in Zustand (global)
- Components get data via props FROM hooks but also read Zustand directly

**Action:** Pick one. Zustand won. Migrate remaining hook state into store slices. Hooks become thin wrappers that call store actions + Tauri invoke. The hooks files can stay as the "action layer" but should not hold state.

### 3.2 — Decompose App.tsx

683 lines, single component. It's doing:
- Splash screen logic
- Onboarding flow
- Action bar (analyze, briefing, export)
- View switching (briefing vs results)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Settings modal
- Error boundary

**Action:** Extract into layout components:
```
App.tsx (100 lines) → shell + routing
  ├── ActionBar.tsx (analyze, briefing, export buttons)
  ├── ViewSwitcher.tsx (tab bar + conditional rendering)
  └── KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx
```

### 3.3 — Wire Up Rust Events

Replace polling with event-driven updates for:
- `analysis-progress` → live progress bar without polling
- `analysis-complete` → immediate result display
- `background-results` → push new items into store
- `cache-updated` → refresh stale data
- `monitoring-toggled` → sync monitoring badge

This makes the app feel instant instead of poll-laggy.

### 3.4 — Frontend Testing

Current: 49 tests across 5 files. Missing coverage on:
- Onboarding flow
- VoidEngine rendering
- BriefingView
- SignalsPanel, KnowledgeGapsPanel
- Store slices

**Action:** Add tests for the 5 most critical user paths:
1. Onboarding → settings saved → analysis triggered
2. Analysis complete → results displayed → filtering works
3. Feedback (save/dismiss) → score adjustment → learning indicator
4. Briefing generation → display
5. Keyboard navigation

---

## Phase 4: Make It Exceptional

### 4.1 — Startup Performance

Current flow: Splash (2.5s) → Onboarding check → Load cached results OR wait 3s then auto-analyze.

**Problem:** The 3s artificial delay before auto-analyze. Plus the 2.5s splash. That's 5.5s before the user sees anything useful.

**Action:**
- Splash: 1s max (or instant if cached results exist)
- Auto-analyze: Start immediately, show results as they stream in
- Use `analysis-progress` events for real-time feedback

### 4.2 — Source Fetch Reliability

11 source adapters hitting external APIs. Any of them can fail (rate limits, network, API changes).

**Action:**
- Ensure every adapter has timeout + retry with backoff
- Surface per-source health in the UI (source_health table exists, wire it up)
- Graceful degradation: if 3/11 sources fail, show results from the 8 that worked with a notice

### 4.3 — Scoring Transparency

The scoring engine is sophisticated (5 axes, domain profile, novelty, content quality). But the user can't see WHY something scored high.

**Action:** The `ScoreAutopsy` component exists. Make it default-visible on hover/expand instead of hidden. Show the dominant signal axis for each result in the list view (e.g., "matched: dependency + interest").

### 4.4 — Offline Mode

Principle #3 says "works offline with Ollama fallback." Verify this actually works:
- Can the app analyze with no internet? (cached sources only)
- Does Ollama reranking work when API keys are empty?
- Does the UI degrade gracefully when offline?

### 4.5 — Binary Size

Tauri + Rust + sqlite-vec + ONNX embeddings. Check the release binary size. If >100MB, audit dependencies. The ONNX model cache (86MB file flagged by GitHub) should be downloaded at first run, not bundled.
