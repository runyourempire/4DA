## Console.dev
Submit at: https://console.dev
Selection criteria: https://console.dev/selection-criteria

**What it does:**
@4da/mcp-server is a 30-tool MCP server that connects AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) to a developer's local codebase. It reads dependency files (Cargo.toml, package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml), builds a context profile, then scores content from Hacker News, arXiv, Reddit, GitHub, and RSS feeds against what the developer actually builds. Everything runs locally via SQLite. No cloud, no telemetry, no account required.

**Install:**
```
npx @4da/mcp-server --setup
```

Section: "Project/Tooling Updates"

**Suggested line:**
[4DA](https://4da.ai) — A Tauri 2.0 desktop application built in Rust that surfaces developer-relevant content from HN, arXiv, Reddit, and GitHub. Uses SQLite + sqlite-vec for local vector search, ocrs for PDF extraction, and ships with a 14-tool MCP server. 1,600+ Rust tests.

## Rust Bytes (Substack)
https://weeklyrust.substack.com/

**Pitch:**
4DA is a Tauri 2.0 desktop app written in Rust (~54 modules, 1,600+ tests) that scores internet content against a developer's actual codebase. It uses sqlite-vec for vector search, ocrs for PDF text extraction, and ships with an Apache-2.0-licensed MCP server (14 tools) on npm. The Rust backend handles content ingestion from 7 source types, local embeddings via Ollama, and a confidence-calibrated scoring algorithm. Privacy-first: no 4DA server; your indexed data stays local. Content sources and any cloud AI you configure are contacted directly from your machine.

## Changelog News
Submit at: https://changelog.com/news/submit

**Title:** @4da/mcp-server — 14 MCP tools for codebase-aware developer intelligence

**Description:**
Most MCP servers wrap a single cloud API. This one ships 14 tools across 9 categories — content scoring, developer context profiling, decision memory, knowledge gap detection, tech radar, trend analysis, and agent session handoff. It reads your local dependency files, builds a context profile of your tech stack, then scores content from HN, arXiv, Reddit, and GitHub against what you actually build. Everything runs locally via SQLite. No cloud, no telemetry, Apache-2.0 licensed.

**Install:** `npx @4da/mcp-server --setup`
**npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4da/mcp-server
